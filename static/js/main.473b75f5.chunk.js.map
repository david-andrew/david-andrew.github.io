At IDT, I focused on both machine learning, and front end development. Of note, I designed a novel machine learning architecture for\n                efficiently allocating compute resources to minimize the execution time of High Level Architecture (HLA) federated simulations. I also\n                implemented a custom time series anomaly detection ensemble model in Julia, and developed the React UI for visualizing the results.\n                <BR />\n                During my master&apos;s coursework I implemented a variety of ML algorithms from scratch, including MLP, SVM, Expectation Maximization, PCA,\n                autoencoding, and autocorrelation/cross-correlation. Additionally, I&apos;ve worked with CNNs, VGG, ResNet, U-net, Viola Jones, and a variety of\n                other architectures. For a <InternalLink to=\"/projects/musical_dl\">capstone project</InternalLink> I developed a novel architecture that\n                leveraged the WaveNet vocoder model paired with a custom convolutional transformer network to create a realistic choral voice synthesizer. Prior\n                to that, at an internship with the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab (JHUAPL), I worked on machine learning capabilities for controlling a\n                robotic limb by analyzing electromyogram (EMG) signals in an individual&apos;s upper arm.\n                <BR />\n                For my undergraduate coursework, I mainly focused on mechanical design, and pure software development. Additionally, I participated in the JHU\n                Robotics Club, where I worked on several interesting robotics projects, including a{' '}\n                <InternalLink to=\"/projects/drawbot\">picture drawing robot arm</InternalLink>, a{' '}\n                <InternalLink to=\"/projects/pongbot\">defintely not beer pong robot</InternalLink>, and a{' '}\n                <InternalLink to=\"/projects/robojay\">Balancing tour guide robot</InternalLink>. I also was a member of the JHU Rocketry Club, where I earned my\n                level 1 High Power Rocketry certification, <InternalLink to=\"/projects/rebel_scum\">attempted unsuccessfully</InternalLink> to earn my level 2\n                certification, and participated in the <InternalLink to=\"/projects/spaceport_america_cup\">2018 Spaceport America Cup</InternalLink>. And also,\n                whenever I had the opportunity, I enjoyed participating in the JHU hackathons held twice a year, leading to projects like{' '}\n                <InternalLink to=\"/projects/ensemble_peabody\">Ensemble (Hacking Harmony)</InternalLink>,{' '}\n                <InternalLink to=\"/projects/boat_simulator\">Boat Simulator</InternalLink>, and{' '}\n                <InternalLink to=\"/projects/bueller_board\">Bueller Board</InternalLink>.\n                <BR />\n                In my spare time, I&apos;ve worked on a number of interesting side projects, including a{' '}\n                <InternalLink to=\"/projects/dewy\">custom programming language</InternalLink>, a{' '}\n                <InternalLink to=\"/projects/so_voice\">deep learning music synthesizer</InternalLink>,{' '}\n                <InternalLink to=\"/projects/escort_mission\">several</InternalLink> <InternalLink to=\"/projects/mehve\">video</InternalLink>{' '}\n                <InternalLink to=\"/projects/lords_of_sola\">games</InternalLink>, as well as a few other{' '}\n                <InternalLink to=\"/projects/blob_opera\">odds</InternalLink> and <InternalLink to=\"/projects/composer\">ends</InternalLink>.

My initial goal was to build a game that demonstrated the\n                    physics of sailing, especially the fact that sailing with the wind is one of the slower directions you can sail.

The app itself is a just a simple webpage with a virtual keyboard, and options to upload your audio file. Additionally the app can\n                    playback midi files, leading to much hilarity. My role mainly consisted of handling the music side of the project, e.g. generating suitable\n                    midi files, figuring out how to handle pitch shifting, etc., while my teammates focused on building the app and intefaces.\n                    <br />\n                    <br />\n                    While quite silly, our project actually ended up winning a prize for crowd favorite.\n                </p>\n                <h3>HopHacks Demo</h3>\n                <YouTube videoId=\"rpgYMfEShjQ\" opts={{ width: '100%' }} />\n            </PageContainer>\n        </>\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react'\nimport { PageContainer, PageHeading } from '../../Components'\nimport { ExternalLink } from '../../utilities'\n\nexport const Composer = (): JSX.Element => {\n    return (\n        <>\n            <PageContainer>\n                <PageHeading title=\"Composer\" subtitle=\"January 2021\" />\n                <p>\n                    Composer is a web-based music entry application I am developing with my brother.

The main goal is to build a language that has the exact feature\n                    set that I&apos;ve always wished existed. Dewy is a general purpose language with a focus on scientific and engineering applications. At a\n                    high level, Dewy is sort of like an amalgamation of the best aspects of Matlab, Python, TypeScript, and Rust, but with its own unique flare.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    So far in development, I have developed the syntax for the language (and meta-language), and have built a prototype{' '}\n                    <ExternalLink href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/david-andrew/dewy/master/resources/Right_Nulled_GLR_Parsers.pdf\">RNGLR</ExternalLink>{' '}\n                    \\{' '}\n                    <ExternalLink href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/david-andrew/dewy/master/resources/Faster_Scannerless_Parsing.pdf\">\n                        SRNGLR\n                    </ExternalLink>{' '}\n                    parser from scratch in C. The next steps are to add some missing features to the parser, write out the language Context Free Grammar (CFG)\n                    in the meta-language, implement the parser back ends (LLVM and C) for generating code from the parse tree, and then build out the standard\n                    library.\n                </p>\n                <h3>Parsing</h3>\n                <p>\n                    All programming languages start with a compiler, which itself is made of several parts, namely: lexing, parsing, semantic analysis, and code\n                    generation. Dewy makes use of a SRNGLR parser which allows the lexing and parsing phases be combined into a single step.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    To parse a mathematical expression like <Code>1 + 2 * 3</Code> we first have to define the grammar for how raw text gets converted to a\n                    parse tree. For this, I&apos;ve developed the Dewy Meta Language which allows for the specification of any Context Free Grammar (CFG), as\n                    well as some context sensitive grammars which can be parsed by SRNGLR. Additionally, the meta-language / parser are optimized to allow for\n                    arbitrary unicode characters as part of the language alphabet, whereas parsers are often limited a much smaller alphabet, e.g. ASCII.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    Normally a grammar must be unambiguous to work with standard LR, LALR, etc. parsers. This complicates the process of writing the grammar, as\n                    often times, the natural way to express a language will be ambiguous, and require careful work to disambiguate. For the math expression{' '}\n                    <Code>1 + 2 * 3</Code>, or any other math expression, the unambiguous version of the grammar might look like this:\n                </p>\n                <CodeBlock flatten text={unambiguousExpressionGrammar} />\n                <p>\n                    Precedence is handled by restricting which expressions can be subexpressions, using different grammar symbols. Associativity is also handled\n                    in a similar fashion, namely the left or right hand side is restricted to specific subexpression types that generate the correct\n                    associativity. Ultimately though, because SRNGLR can handle ambiguities, the grammar can be simplified to something like this:\n                </p>\n                <CodeBlock flatten text={ambiguousExpressionGrammar} />\n                <p>\n                    Note that for the ambiguous grammar, precedence and associativity still need to be handled at some point in the process. SRNGLR just\n                    provides the flexibility to handle them later in the parsing process, when it is much more convenient.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    Running the first grammar on <Code>1 + 2 * 3</Code> we get the following parse tree\n                </p>\n                <CodeBlock\n                    flatten\n                    text={`#start:0\n├── #__4:0\n│   ├── #__5:0\n│   │   ├── ϵ\n│   │   └── #S:0\n│   │       ├── #S:2\n│   │       │   └── #A:2\n│   │       │       └── #E:1\n│   │       │           └── #T:0\n│   │       │               └── #N:0\n│   │       │                   ├── 1\n│   │       │                   └── ϵ: #__2\n│   │       ├── #__1:0\n│   │       │   ├── #w:0\n│   │       │   │   └── \\\\x20\n│   │       │   └── ϵ: #__1\n│   │       ├── +\n│   │       ├── #__1:0\n│   │       │   ├── #w:0\n│   │       │   │   └── \\\\x20\n│   │       │   └── ϵ: #__1\n│   │       └── #A:0\n│   │           ├── #A:2\n│   │           │   └── #E:1\n│   │           │       └── #T:0\n│   │           │           └── #N:0\n│   │           │               ├── 2\n│   │           │               └── ϵ: #__2\n│   │           ├── #__1:0\n│   │           │   ├── #w:0\n│   │           │   │   └── \\\\x20\n│   │           │   └── ϵ: #__1\n│   │           ├── *\n│   │           ├── #__1:0\n│   │           │   ├── #w:0\n│   │           │   │   └── \\\\x20\n│   │           │   └── ϵ: #__1\n│   │           └── #E:1\n│   │               └── #T:0\n│   │                   └── #N:0\n│   │                       ├── 3\n│   │                       └── ϵ: #__2\n│   └── ϵ: #__6\n└── ϵ: #__1`}\n                />\n\n                <p>while parsing the same input with the ambiguous grammar returns the following parse forest:</p>\n                <CodeBlock\n                    flatten\n                    text={` 0 #start:0\n 1 ├── #__4:0\n 2 │   ├── ϵ\n 3 │   └── [#E:2]\n 4 │       ├───┬── #E:1\n 5 │       │   │   ├── #E:4\n 6 │       │   │   │   └── #N:0\n 7 │       │   │   │       ├── 1\n 8 │       │   │   │       └── ϵ: #__2\n 9 │       │   │   ├── #__1:0\n10 │       │   │   │   ├── #ws:0\n11 │       │   │   │   │   └── \\\\x20\n12 │       │   │   │   └── ϵ: #__1\n13 │       │   │   ├── +\n14 │       │   │   ├── #__1:0\n15 │       │   │   │   ├── #ws:0\n16 │       │   │   │   │   └── \\\\x20\n17 │       │   │   │   └── ϵ: #__1\n18 │       │   │   └── #E:4\n19 │       │   │       └── #N:0\n20 │       │   │           ├── 2\n21 │       │   │           └── ϵ: #__2\n22 │       │   ├── #__1:0\n23 │       │   │   ├── #ws:0\n24 │       │   │   │   └── \\\\x20\n25 │       │   │   └── ϵ: #__1\n26 │       │   ├── *\n27 │       │   ├── #__1:0\n28 │       │   │   ├── #ws:0\n29 │       │   │   │   └── \\\\x20\n30 │       │   │   └── ϵ: #__1\n31 │       │   └── #E:4\n32 │       │       └── #N:0\n33 │       │           ├── 3\n34 │       │           └── ϵ: #__2\n35 │       └───┬── @5\n36 │           ├── @9\n37 │           ├── +\n38 │           ├── @14\n39 │           └── #E:2\n40 │               ├── @18\n41 │               ├── @22\n42 │               ├── *\n43 │               ├── @27\n44 │               └── @31\n45 └── ϵ: #__5`}\n                />\n                <p>\n                    Notice the ambiguity nodes for <Code>#E</Code> on lines 4 and 35, representing the two options for parsing the expression, namely{' '}\n                    <Code>(1 + 2) * 3</Code> vs <Code>1 + (2 * 3)</Code> respectively\n                </p>\n                <h3>Semantic Analysis &amp; Code Generation</h3>\n                <p>\n                    The next steps involve implementing the semantic analysis, and code generation pieces of the compiler.

The parse trees need to be analyzed to ensure that they\n                    follow the languages semantics, e.g. variables may only be referenced when in scope, function calls have the same number of arguments as\n                    their definitions, type safety checks, etc.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    After semantic analysis, the last step of the compiler is code generation.

The goal\n                    is to develop a choir synthesizer that leverages deep learning to produce audio indistinguishable from real recordings.\n                </p>\n                <h3>Method</h3>\n                <p>\n                    Since I intend to commercialize so voice! in the near future, I wont&apos;t go into too much detail about the inner workings on here. But at\n                    a high level, so voice! consists of two main parts: the parsing engine, and the synthesizer. The parsing engine reads in sheet music,\n                    currently from well formed (read curated) MusicXML files, and converts them to a serial representation that can be fed into a machine\n                    learning pipeline. The synthesizer then pipes that representation through a series of deep learning models which ultimately output an audio\n                    file that is the synthesized performance of the input. Eventually I&apos;d also like to add in a machine learning pipeline for reading sheet\n                    music from images (e.g. PDFs).\n                    <br />\n                    <br />\n                    In terms of the actual machine learning pipeline, I have been developing custom architectures ever since I started working on the project in\n                    early 2019. Initially I centered my design around the WaveNet, which Google uses to great effect for their Text-to-Speech service, however\n                    several compounding factors cause WaveNets to be unsuitable for choral voice synthesis, e.g. difficulty parallelizing, low output sample\n                    rates, small pitch range, etc. More recently a <ExternalLink href=\"https://magenta.tensorflow.org/ddsp\">article/paper</ExternalLink> by\n                    project magenta has piqued my interest, and I have since developed several prototype differentiable synthesizer networks that leverage those\n                    techniques. I&apos;m also very interested in experimenting with transformers, which I think have good prospects to work well in the\n                    pipelines I&apos;ve been building.\n                </p>\n                <h3>Current Examples</h3>\n                <AudioExamplePair\n                    title=\"Audio Resynthesis\"\n                    pairs={[\n                        {\n                            audio1: { label: 'Real audio (16000 Hz)', src: atma16000 },\n                            audio2: { label: 'Resynthesized version', src: atma16000resynth },\n                        },\n                    ]}\n                />\n                <AudioExamplePair\n                    title=\"Auto-Encoder GAN Experiment\"\n                    pairs={[\n                        {\n                            audio1: { label: 'Real audio (16000 Hz)', src: pando_260800_4_y },\n                            audio2: { label: 'Auto-encoded version', src: pando_260800_4_y_hat },\n                        },\n                    ]}\n                />\n                <AudioExamplePair\n                    title=\"LPC Synthesis Experiment\"\n                    pairs={[\n                        {\n                            audio1: { label: 'When David Heard - Full lyrics', src: when_david_heard_lpc },\n                            audio2: { label: \"When David Heard - No lyrics (Aaah's)\", src: when_david_heard_lpc_aaa },\n                        },\n                    ]}\n                />\n                <h3>Future</h3>\n                so voice! is the next project on in my queue to focus on, so I&apos;m hoping to get some good progress in over the coming year.

The theme of the jam was &quot;Out of Control&quot;,\n                    as fun play on the out of control feeling present in the thick of the worldwide pandemic. The entire game was created from scratch during\n                    the 48 hour-long game jam.\n                    <br />\n                    <br />\n                    For our game, we wanted it to feel like the player was managing too many things leading to that feeling of out of control. After much\n                    brainstorming, we landed on the concept of sheep herding, where you control sheep dogs, and have to guide non-cooperative sheep away from\n                    danger, and towards the goal. And to make it feel extra <em>out of control</em>, we gave the player simultaneous control of 4 dogs. As the\n                    player progresses, obstacles become more difficult to manuever around, and adversarial wolves show up and attempt to eat the sheep.\n                    <br />\n                    <br />\n                    Early on, I decided that we would make the game in the Godot game engine&mdash;I was turned off of Unity3D from{' '}\n                    <InternalLink to=\"/projects/boat_simulator\">past</InternalLink> <InternalLink to=\"/projects/rewind\">experiences</InternalLink> with it, and\n                    had been hearing only good things about the new Godot engine. For the game jam, my brother handled all art related aspects (sprites,\n                    backgrounds, music, sound effects, etc.), while I handled coding the game itself. Mechanically the game is super simple: sheep use the{' '}\n                    <ExternalLink href=\"https://eater.net/boids\">Boids Algorithm</ExternalLink> to wander around the screen, while each of the player controlled\n                    dogs exert a repulsive force on nearby sheep. The enemy wolf AI is literally just{' '}\n                    <em>walk in a circle until a sheep is nearby, and then chase/attempt to eat it</em>. The player also applies a repulsive force to the\n                    wolves, which allows them to protect sheep in danger.\n                </p>\n                <h3>Photos</h3>\n                <Collage imageSrcs={imageSrcs} />\n                <h3>Gameplay Video</h3>\n                <p>After submissions were closed, we were lucky enough to have a streamer feature our game</p>\n                <YouTube videoId=\"NSteCRVER3A\" opts={{ width: '100%', playerVars: { start: 10, end: 125 } }} />\n                <h3>Try It</h3>\n                <List>\n                    <List.Item>\n                        <span>\n                            <Icon name=\"linux\" size=\"big\" />\n                            <ExternalLink href=\"https://github.com/david-andrew/escort_mission_2020/releases/download/0.5.0/linux_0_5_0.zip\">\n                                escort mission 0.5.0 (linux)\n                            </ExternalLink>\n                        </span>\n                    </List.Item>\n                    <List.Item>\n                        <span>\n                            <Icon name=\"windows\" size=\"big\" />\n                            <ExternalLink href=\"https://github.com/david-andrew/escort_mission_2020/releases/download/0.5.0/windows_0_5_0.zip\">\n                                escort mission 0.5.0 (windows)\n                            </ExternalLink>\n                        </span>\n                    </List.Item>\n                    <List.Item>\n                        <span>\n                            <Icon name=\"apple\" size=\"big\" />\n                            <ExternalLink href=\"https://github.com/david-andrew/escort_mission_2020/releases/download/0.5.0/mac_0_5_0.zip\">\n                                escort mission 0.5.0 (mac)\n                            </ExternalLink>\n                        </span>\n                    </List.Item>\n                </List>\n\n                <h3>Links</h3>\n                <List>\n                    <List.Item>\n                        <span>\n                            <Icon name=\"gamepad\" size=\"big\" />\n                            <ExternalLink href=\"https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2020/rate/696988\"> GMTK Submission Page </ExternalLink>\n                        </span>\n                    </List.Item>\n                    <List.Item>\n                        <span>\n                            <Icon name=\"gamepad\" size=\"big\" />\n                            <ExternalLink href=\"https://dsamson.itch.io/escort-mission-2020\"> Itch.io Game Page</ExternalLink>\n                        </span>\n                    </List.Item>\n                    <List.Item>\n                        <span>\n                            <Icon name=\"github\" size=\"big\" />\n                            <ExternalLink href=\"https://github.com/david-andrew/escort_mission_2020\"> Github Repo</ExternalLink>\n                        </span>\n                    </List.Item>\n                </List>\n            </PageContainer>\n        </>\n    )\n}\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/cad_design.5f59dd6c.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/joystick_demo.c87bb25f.gif\";","import React from 'react'\nimport { Collage, PageContainer, PageHeading } from '../../Components'\nimport { ClearFixAfter, ExternalLink } from '../../utilities'\nimport YouTube from 'react-youtube'\nimport cad_design from '../../images/foxing_animatronic/cad_design.png'\nimport joystick_demo from '../../images/foxing_animatronic/joystick_demo.gif'\n\nexport const FoxingAnimatronic = (): JSX.Element => {\n    //image objects for photo collage\n    const r = require.context('../../images/foxing_animatronic/album')\n    const imageSrcs = r.keys().map((path: string) => r(path).default) as string[]\n\n    return (\n        <>\n            <PageContainer>\n                <PageHeading title=\"Foxing Animatronic\" subtitle=\"June 2018\" />\n                <p>\n                    Early in 2018, I was tasked by the band Foxing to help develop an animatronic for an upcoming music video they were shooting.

The band had also hired\n                    sculpter <ExternalLink href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jakecorricksculpture\">Jake Corrick</ExternalLink> to model the exterior of the prop,\n                    so my task was mainly to develop the internal structure and control mechanisms, and ensure that it matched the vision Foxing was going for.\n                    <br />\n                    <br />I opted for laser cut acrylic with a stiff plastic spine and thin steel cables to control the mechanism.

One\n                    joystick controls the lower body, with cables running up only halfway through the robot, while the other joystick controls the upper body.\n                    The bicycle brakes attach to cables that actuate the arms as well as the head petal mechanism. The entire control assembly was mounted to a\n                    piece of plywood from which the steel cables had a strong anchor to pull against.\n                </p>\n                <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>\n                    <img src={joystick_demo} style={{ width: '50%' }} />\n                </div>\n                <p>\n                    <br />\n                    <br />\n                    The biggest difficulty I encountered with the project was the slender proportions they wanted. With such a thin frame, the cables needed to\n                    be as thin as possible to fit through the small holes in each disk on the body, which meant they were more fragile than thicker cabling--I\n                    calculated that there was almost no margin of safety for the breaking strength of the control cables. Ultimately, it took a lot of careful\n                    and delicate work to ensure the whole mechanism would work as intended without breaking.\n                </p>\n                <h3>Pictures</h3>\n                <Collage imageSrcs={imageSrcs} />\n\n                <h3>Final Music Video (Warning: Blood/Unsettling Medical Imagery)</h3>\n                <YouTube videoId=\"AopbOIH37gs\" opts={{ width: '100%' }} />\n            </PageContainer>\n        </>\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react'\nimport { PageContainer } from '../../Components'\n\nexport const LordsOfSola = (): JSX.Element => {\n    return (\n        <>\n            <PageContainer>\n                <h1>Lords of Sola</h1>\n            </PageContainer>\n        </>\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react'\nimport { PageContainer } from '../../Components'\n\nexport const Mechatronics = (): JSX.Element => {\n    return (\n        <>\n            <PageContainer>\n                <h1>Mechatronics</h1>\n            </PageContainer>\n        </>\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react'\nimport { PageContainer } from '../../Components'\n\nexport const Mehve = (): JSX.Element => {\n    return (\n        <>\n            <PageContainer>\n                <h1>Mehve</h1>\n            </PageContainer>\n        </>\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react'\nimport { PageContainer } from '../../Components'\n\nexport const MusicalDL = (): JSX.Element => {\n    return (\n        <>\n            <PageContainer>\n                <h1>Musical Deep Learning</h1>\n            </PageContainer>\n        </>\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react'\nimport { PageContainer } from '../../Components'\n\nexport const PongBot = (): JSX.Element => {\n    return (\n        <>\n            <PageContainer>\n                <h1>pOngBot</h1>\n            </PageContainer>\n        </>\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react'\nimport { PageContainer } from '../../Components'\n\nexport const PRS19 = (): JSX.Element => {\n    return (\n        <>\n            <PageContainer>\n                <h1>PRS19</h1>\n            </PageContainer>\n        </>\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react'\nimport { PageContainer } from '../../Components'\n\nexport const RebelScum = (): JSX.Element => {\n    return (\n        <>\n            <PageContainer>\n                <h1>Rebel Scum High Power Rocket</h1>\n            </PageContainer>\n        </>\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react'\nimport { PageContainer } from '../../Components'\n\nexport const Rewind = (): JSX.Element => {\n    return (\n        <>\n            <PageContainer>\n                <h1>Rewind</h1>\n            </PageContainer>\n        </>\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react'\nimport { PageContainer } from '../../Components'\n\nexport const RoboJay = (): JSX.Element => {\n    return (\n        <>\n            <PageContainer>\n                <h1>RoboJay</h1>\n            </PageContainer>\n        </>\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react'\nimport { PageContainer } from '../../Components'\n\nexport const SpaceportAmericaCup = (): JSX.Element => {\n    return (\n        <>\n            <PageContainer>\n                <h1>Spaceport America Cup</h1>\n            </PageContainer>\n        </>\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react'\nimport { Icon } from 'semantic-ui-react'\nimport { PageContainer, PageHeading } from '../../Components'\nimport { ExternalLink } from '../../utilities'\nimport { useGithubTimestamp } from '../../utilities'\n\nexport const SkipSpoilers = (): JSX.Element => {\n    //get the timestamp subtitle\n    const subtitle = useGithubTimestamp('uSkipSpoilers')\n\n    return (\n        <>\n            <PageContainer>\n                <PageHeading title=\"uSkipSpoilers\" subtitle={subtitle} />\n                <p>\n                    uSkipSpoilers is a small chrome extension I made mostly as a joke for my brother who is extremely spoiler averse.

So for example, say I want to send a youtube video to my brother about a something, but I notice it contains spoilers for a movie\n                    he is planning to watch, I can annotate the
