At IDT, I focused on both machine learning, and front end development. Of note, I designed a novel machine learning architecture for\n                efficiently allocating compute resources to minimize the execution time of High Level Architecture (HLA) federated simulations. I also\n                implemented a custom time series anomaly detection ensemble model in Julia, and developed the React UI for visualizing the results.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                During my master&apos;s coursework I implemented a variety of ML algorithms from scratch, including MLP, SVM, Expectation Maximization, PCA,\n                autoencoding, and autocorrelation/cross-correlation. Additionally, I&apos;ve worked with CNNs, VGG, ResNet, U-net, Viola Jones, and a variety of\n                other architectures. For a <InternalLink to=\"/projects/musical_dl\">capstone project</InternalLink> I developed a novel architecture that\n                leveraged the WaveNet vocoder model paired with a custom convolutional transformer network to create a realistic choral voice synthesizer. Prior\n                to that, at an internship with the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab (JHUAPL), I worked on machine learning capabilities for controlling a\n                robotic limb by analyzing electromyogram (EMG) signals in an individual&apos;s upper arm.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                For my undergraduate coursework, I mainly focused on mechanical design, and pure software development.

My initial goal was to build a game that demonstrated the\n                    physics of sailing, especially the fact that sailing with the wind is one of the slower directions you can sail. Ultimately, building a\n                    completely accurate simulation was a bit beyond my Unity skills, but, with some suggestions from family, I did end up with a fun little\n                    meditative experience.\n                    <br />\n                    <br />\n                    The player controls a small boat sailing along an endless ocean under a starry sky. John Tavener&apos;s Song for Athene provides an ethereal\n                    soundscape for the dreamlike scene. The entire game lasts for about 7 minutes, with the boat picking up speed towards the climax of the\n                    song, and ultimately taking off for the great beyond.\n                </p>\n                <h3>Photos</h3>\n                <Collage imageSrcs={imageSrcs} rowSizes={[1, 2, 3]} />\n                <h3>Try It</h3>\n                <List>\n                    <List.Item>\n                        <span>\n                            <Icon name=\"windows\" size=\"big\" />\n                            <ExternalLink href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/95v6y2a4zgls45y/Build11_Windows_64_bit.zip?dl=0\">\n                                Boat Simulator Build 11\n                            </ExternalLink>\n                        </span>\n                    </List.Item>\n                    <List.Item>\n                        <span>\n                            <Icon name=\"apple\" size=\"big\" />\n                            Recommend using <ExternalLink href=\"https://www.winehq.org/\">Wine</ExternalLink>\n                        </span>\n                    </List.Item>\n                    <List.Item>\n                        <span>\n                            <Icon name=\"linux\" size=\"big\" />\n                            Recommend using <ExternalLink href=\"https://www.winehq.org/\">Wine</ExternalLink>\n                        </span>\n                    </List.Item>\n                </List>\n            </PageContainer>\n        </>\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react'\nimport { PageContainer, PageHeading } from '../../Components'\nimport YouTube from 'react-youtube'\n\nexport const BuellerBoard = (): JSX.Element => {\n    return (\n        <>\n            <PageContainer>\n                <PageHeading title=\"Bueller Board\" subtitle=\"September 2015\" />\n                <h3>About</h3>\n                <p>\n                    In fall 2015 I attended my first hackathon.

The app itself is a just a simple webpage with a virtual keyboard, and options to upload your audio file. Additionally the app can\n                    playback midi files, leading to much hilarity. My role mainly consisted of handling the music side of the project, e.g. generating suitable\n                    midi files, figuring out how to handle pitch shifting, etc., while my teammates focused on building the app and intefaces.\n                    <br />\n                    <br />\n                    While quite silly, our project actually ended up winning a prize for crowd favorite.\n                </p>\n                <h3>HopHacks Demo</h3>\n                <YouTube videoId=\"rpgYMfEShjQ\" opts={{ width: '100%' }} />\n            </PageContainer>\n        </>\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react'\nimport { PageContainer, PageHeading } from '../../Components'\nimport { ExternalLink } from '../../utilities'\n\nexport const Composer = (): JSX.Element => {\n    return (\n        <>\n            <PageContainer>\n                <PageHeading title=\"Composer\" subtitle=\"January 2021\" />\n                <p>\n                    Composer is a web-based music entry application I am developing with my brother.

For this, I&apos;ve developed the Dewy Meta Language which allows for the specification of any Context Free Grammar (CFG), as\n                    well as some context sensitive grammars which can be parsed by SRNGLR. Additionally, the meta-language / parser are optimized to allow for\n                    arbitrary unicode characters as part of the language alphabet, whereas parsers are often limited a much smaller alphabet, e.g. ASCII.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    Normally a grammar must be unambiguous to work with standard LR, LALR, etc. parsers. This complicates the process of writing the grammar, as\n                    often times, the natural way to express a language will be ambiguous, and require careful work to disambiguate. For the math expression{' '}\n                    <Code>1 + 2 * 3</Code>, or any other math expression, the unambiguous version of the grammar might look like this:\n                </p>\n                <CodeBlock flatten text={unambiguousExpressionGrammar.grammar} />\n                <p>\n                    Precedence is handled by restricting which expressions can be subexpressions, using different grammar symbols. Associativity is also handled\n                    in a similar fashion, namely the left or right hand side is restricted to specific subexpression types that generate the correct\n                    associativity. Ultimately though, because SRNGLR can handle ambiguities, the grammar can be simplified to something like this:\n                </p>\n                <CodeBlock flatten text={ambiguousExpressionGrammar.grammar} />\n                <p>\n                    Note that for the ambiguous grammar, precedence and associativity still need to be handled at some point in the process. SRNGLR just\n                    provides the flexibility to handle them later in the parsing process, when it is much more convenient.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    Running the first grammar on <Code>1 + 2 * 3</Code> we get the following parse tree\n                </p>\n                <CodeBlock\n                    flatten\n                    text={`#start:0\n├── #__4:0\n│   ├── #__5:0\n│   │   ├── ϵ\n│   │   └── #S:0\n│   │       ├── #S:2\n│   │       │   └── #A:2\n│   │       │       └── #E:1\n│   │       │           └── #T:0\n│   │       │               └── #N:0\n│   │       │                   ├── 1\n│   │       │                   └── ϵ: #__2\n│   │       ├── #__1:0\n│   │       │   ├── #w:0\n│   │       │   │   └── \\\\x20\n│   │       │   └── ϵ: #__1\n│   │       ├── +\n│   │       ├── #__1:0\n│   │       │   ├── #w:0\n│   │       │   │   └── \\\\x20\n│   │       │   └── ϵ: #__1\n│   │       └── #A:0\n│   │           ├── #A:2\n│   │           │   └── #E:1\n│   │           │       └── #T:0\n│   │           │           └── #N:0\n│   │           │               ├── 2\n│   │           │               └── ϵ: #__2\n│   │           ├── #__1:0\n│   │           │   ├── #w:0\n│   │           │   │   └── \\\\x20\n│   │           │   └── ϵ: #__1\n│   │           ├── *\n│   │           ├── #__1:0\n│   │           │   ├── #w:0\n│   │           │   │   └── \\\\x20\n│   │           │   └── ϵ: #__1\n│   │           └── #E:1\n│   │               └── #T:0\n│   │                   └── #N:0\n│   │                       ├── 3\n│   │                       └── ϵ: #__2\n│   └── ϵ: #__6\n└── ϵ: #__1`}\n                />\n                <p>while parsing the same input with the ambiguous grammar returns the following parse forest:</p>\n                <CodeBlock\n                    flatten\n                    text={` 0 #start:0\n 1 ├── #__4:0\n 2 │   ├── ϵ\n 3 │   └── [#E:2]\n 4 │       ├───┬── #E:1\n 5 │       │   │   ├── #E:4\n 6 │       │   │   │   └── #N:0\n 7 │       │   │   │       ├── 1\n 8 │       │   │   │       └── ϵ: #__2\n 9 │       │   │   ├── #__1:0\n10 │       │   │   │   ├── #ws:0\n11 │       │   │   │   │   └── \\\\x20\n12 │       │   │   │   └── ϵ: #__1\n13 │       │   │   ├── +\n14 │       │   │   ├── #__1:0\n15 │       │   │   │   ├── #ws:0\n16 │       │   │   │   │   └── \\\\x20\n17 │       │   │   │   └── ϵ: #__1\n18 │       │   │   └── #E:4\n19 │       │   │       └── #N:0\n20 │       │   │           ├── 2\n21 │       │   │           └── ϵ: #__2\n22 │       │   ├── #__1:0\n23 │       │   │   ├── #ws:0\n24 │       │   │   │   └── \\\\x20\n25 │       │   │   └── ϵ: #__1\n26 │       │   ├── *\n27 │       │   ├── #__1:0\n28 │       │   │   ├── #ws:0\n29 │       │   │   │   └── \\\\x20\n30 │       │   │   └── ϵ: #__1\n31 │       │   └── #E:4\n32 │       │       └── #N:0\n33 │       │           ├── 3\n34 │       │           └── ϵ: #__2\n35 │       └───┬── @5\n36 │           ├── @9\n37 │           ├── +\n38 │           ├── @14\n39 │           └── #E:2\n40 │               ├── @18\n41 │               ├── @22\n42 │               ├── *\n43 │               ├── @27\n44 │               └── @31\n45 └── ϵ: #__5`}\n                />\n                <p>\n                    Notice the ambiguity nodes for <Code>#E</Code> on lines 4 and 35, representing the two options for parsing the expression, namely{' '}\n                    <Code>(1 + 2) * 3</Code> vs <Code>1 + (2 * 3)</Code> respectively\n                </p>\n                <h3>Semantic Analysis &amp; Code Generation</h3>\n                <p>\n                    The next steps involve implementing the semantic analysis, and code generation pieces of the compiler. With a suitable CFG specification for\n                    the language, the SRNGLR parser will output parse trees for given input source text. The parse trees need to be analyzed to ensure that they\n                    follow the languages semantics, e.g. variables may only be referenced when in scope, function calls have the same number of arguments as\n                    their definitions, type safety checks, etc.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    After semantic analysis, the last step of the compiler is code generation.

I&apos;m also planning to have an optional C code generator, which would allow for\n                    extreme levels of portability in the compiler&mdash;most systems could build and run the Dewy compiler, as a C99 compiler would be the only\n                    dependency.\n                </p>\n                <h3>Build It Yourself</h3>\n                <p>Since the language is far from complete, the most you can build right now is the SRNGLR parser.</p>\n                <CodeBlock\n                    language=\"bash\"\n                    text={`$ git clone git@github.com:david-andrew/dewy.git\n$ cd dewy/src/compiler\n$ make dewy\n$ ./dewy path/to/grammar/file path/to/source/file`}\n                />\n                <p>\n                    The project includes several test grammar/source file pairs in the <Code>tests/</Code> directory. e.g. the simple expression grammars from\n                    above could be run like so:\n                </p>\n                <CodeBlock\n                    language=\"bash\"\n                    text={`$ ./dewy ../../tests/grammar8.dewy ../../tests/source8.dewy #ambiguous version\n$ ./dewy ../../tests/grammar3.dewy ../../tests/source8.dewy #unambiguous version`}\n                />\n                <h3>Links</h3>\n                <List>\n                    <List.Item>\n                        <span>\n                            <Icon name=\"github\" size=\"big\" />\n                            <ExternalLink href=\"https://github.com/david-andrew/dewy\">Github Repo</ExternalLink>\n                        </span>\n                    </List.Item>\n                    <List.Item>\n                        <span>\n                            <Icon name=\"trello\" size=\"big\" />\n                            <ExternalLink href=\"https://trello.com/b/YYsedENy/dewyspeak\">Project Trello Board</ExternalLink>\n                        </span>\n                    </List.Item>\n                    <List.Item>\n                        <span>\n                            <Icon name=\"file alternate\" size=\"big\" />\n                            <ExternalLink href=\"https://david-andrew.github.io/dewy/\">Language Documentation</ExternalLink>\n                        </span>\n                    </List.Item>\n                </List>\n            </PageContainer>\n        </>\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react'\nimport { PageContainer, PageHeading, Collage } from '../../Components'\nimport { ExternalLink } from '../../utilities'\nimport YouTube from 'react-youtube'\nimport { Icon, List } from 'semantic-ui-react'\n\nexport const DrawRobot = (): JSX.Element => {\n    const r = require.context('../../images/drawbot')\n    const imageSrcs = r.keys().map((path: string) => r(path).default) as string[]\n\n    return (\n        <>\n            <PageContainer>\n                <PageHeading title=\"UR5 Draw Robot\" subtitle=\"December 2017\" />\n                <p>\n                    As a part of the Robotics Master&apos;s degree, students are required to take Robot Kinematics, Dynamics, and Control (EN.530.646), a\n                    rigorous overview of the math used in robotics.

The parsing engine reads in sheet music,\n                    currently from well formed (read curated) MusicXML files, and converts them to a serial representation that can be fed into a machine\n                    learning pipeline. The synthesizer then pipes that representation through a series of deep learning models which ultimately output an audio\n                    file that is the synthesized performance of the input. Eventually I&apos;d also like to add in a machine learning pipeline for reading sheet\n                    music from images (e.g. PDFs).\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    In terms of the actual machine learning pipeline, I have been developing custom architectures ever since I started working on the project in\n                    early 2019. Initially I centered my design around the WaveNet, which Google uses to great effect for their Text-to-Speech service, however\n                    several compounding factors cause WaveNets to be unsuitable for choral voice synthesis, e.g. difficulty parallelizing, low output sample\n                    rates, small pitch range, etc. More recently a <ExternalLink href=\"https://magenta.tensorflow.org/ddsp\">article/paper</ExternalLink> by\n                    project magenta has piqued my interest, and I have since developed several prototype differentiable synthesizer networks that leverage those\n                    techniques. I&apos;m also very interested in experimenting with transformers, which I think have good prospects to work well in the\n                    pipelines I&apos;ve been building.\n                </p>\n                <h3>Current Example</h3>\n                <p>\n                    This demonstrates the final step in the pipeline which generates audio given output from all the previous steps. To test it in isolation, I\n                    have it attempt to recreate real audio clips, which gives an idea of how well it will perform in the full pipeline.\n                </p>\n                <AudioExamplePair\n                    title=\"Audio Resynthesis\"\n                    pairs={[\n                        {\n                            audio1: { label: 'Real audio (16000 Hz)', src: atma16000 },\n                            audio2: { label: 'Resynthesized version', src: atma16000resynth },\n                        },\n                    ]}\n                />\n                <h3>Previous Experiments</h3>\n                <p>\n                    These demonstrate a few previous approaches I tried for audio generation.

The theme of the jam was &quot;Out of Control&quot;,\n                    as fun play on the out of control feeling present in the thick of the worldwide pandemic. The entire game was created from scratch during\n                    the 48 hour-long game jam.\n                    <br />\n                    <br />\n                    For our game, we wanted it to feel like the player was managing too many things leading to that feeling of out of control. After much\n                    brainstorming, we landed on the concept of sheep herding, where you control sheep dogs, and have to guide non-cooperative sheep away from\n                    danger, and towards the goal. And to make it feel extra <em>out of control</em>, we gave the player simultaneous control of 4 dogs. As the\n                    player progresses, obstacles become more difficult to manuever around, and adversarial wolves show up and attempt to eat the sheep.\n                    <br />\n                    <br />\n                    Early on, I decided that we would make the game in the Godot game engine&mdash;I was turned off of Unity3D from{' '}\n                    <InternalLink to=\"/projects/boat_simulator\">past</InternalLink> <InternalLink to=\"/projects/rewind\">experiences</InternalLink> with it, and\n                    had been hearing only good things about the new Godot engine. For the game jam, my brother handled all art related aspects (sprites,\n                    backgrounds, music, sound effects, etc.), while I handled coding the game itself.

One\n                    joystick controls the lower body, with cables running up only halfway through the robot, while the other joystick controls the upper body.\n                    The bicycle brakes attach to cables that actuate the arms as well as the head petal mechanism. The entire control assembly was mounted to a\n                    piece of plywood from which the steel cables had a strong anchor to pull against.\n                </p>\n                <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>\n                    <img src={joystick_demo} style={{ width: '50%' }} />\n                </div>\n                <p>\n                    <br />\n                    <br />\n                    The biggest difficulty I encountered with the project was the slender proportions they wanted. With such a thin frame, the cables needed to\n                    be as thin as possible to fit through the small holes in each disk on the body, which meant they were more fragile than thicker cabling--I\n                    calculated that there was almost no margin of safety for the breaking strength of the control cables. Ultimately, it took a lot of careful\n                    and delicate work to ensure the whole mechanism would work as intended without breaking.\n                </p>\n                <h3>Pictures</h3>\n                <Collage imageSrcs={imageSrcs} />\n\n                <h3>Final Music Video (Warning: Blood/Unsettling Medical Imagery)</h3>\n                <YouTube videoId=\"AopbOIH37gs\" opts={{ width: '100%' }} />\n            </PageContainer>\n        </>\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react'\nimport { PageContainer, PageHeading } from '../../Components'\n\nexport const LordsOfSola = (): JSX.Element => {\n    return (\n        <>\n            <PageContainer>\n                <PageHeading title=\"Lords of Sola\" subtitle=\"\" />\n                <h3>Coming Soon</h3>\n            </PageContainer>\n        </>\n    )\n}\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/striker_shooting.2bfb57e8.gif\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/goalie_moving.0846c880.gif\";","import React from 'react'\nimport { PageContainer, PageHeading, Collage } from '../../Components'\nimport { ExternalLink } from '../../utilities'\nimport YouTube from 'react-youtube'\nimport { Grid } from 'semantic-ui-react'\nimport striker_shooting from '../../images/mechatronics/jhockey/striker_shooting.gif'\nimport goalie_moving from '../../images/mechatronics/jhockey/goalie_moving.gif'\n\nexport const Mechatronics = (): JSX.Element => {\n    const mazeSolver_r = require.context('../../images/mechatronics/maze_solver')\n    const mazeSolver_imageSrcs = mazeSolver_r.keys().map((path: string) => mazeSolver_r(path).default) as string[]\n\n    const balancer_r = require.context('../../images/mechatronics/balancer')\n    const balancer_imageSrcs = balancer_r.keys().map((path: string) => balancer_r(path).default) as string[]\n\n    const jhockey_goalie_r = require.context('../../images/mechatronics/jhockey/goalie')\n    const jhockey_goalie_imageSrcs = jhockey_goalie_r.keys().map((path: string) => jhockey_goalie_r(path).default) as string[]\n    const jhockey_striker_r = require.context('../../images/mechatronics/jhockey/striker')\n    const jhockey_striker_imageSrcs = jhockey_striker_r.keys().map((path: string) => jhockey_striker_r(path).default) as string[]\n\n    return (\n        <>\n            <PageContainer>\n                <PageHeading title=\"Mechatronics\" subtitle=\"May 2019\" />\n                <p>\n                    During my final graduate semester at JHU, I participated in Mechatronics (EN.530.421) where I built several small scale robots from scratch.\n                </p>\n                <h3>Maze Solving Robot</h3>\n                <p>\n                    The first robot we built was a maze solving robot. For sensors, we were allowed a single{' '}\n                    <ExternalLink href=\"https://pixycam.com/pixy-cmucam5/\">PixyCam</ExternalLink>, an ultrasonic depth sensor, and a pair of flexible\n                    deformation sensors. For this robot, I was on a team with two other people. My responsibilities consisted of designing and fabricating the\n                    chassis, while they focused on programming the robot. To solve the maze, the robot may use any algorithm, as well as use the colored square\n                    hints placed throughout the maze.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    An interesting feature of the chassis design is that it was design to fit together using nothing but friction joints. This means that each\n                    joint is slightly larger than where it is supposed to fit, and the interference between both sides holds the parts together&mdash;no glue\n                    was needed, and the only fasteners were to hold components to the body. Normally, laser cut acrylic isn&apos;t cut with such tight\n                    tolerances, but with a little bit of experimentation, I was able to get it to work quite nicely.\n                </p>\n                <Grid columns={2}>\n                    <Grid.Column>\n                        <Grid.Row>\n                            <Collage imageSrcs={mazeSolver_imageSrcs} />\n                        </Grid.Row>\n                    </Grid.Column>\n                    <Grid.Column>\n                        <Grid.Row>\n                            <YouTube videoId=\"_ZzZNforl5k\" opts={{ width: '100%', height: '753px' }} />\n                        </Grid.Row>\n                    </Grid.Column>\n                </Grid>\n                <h3>Balancing Robot</h3>\n                <p>\n                    The second robot we built was a robot designed to balance along a single axis. For sensors, we were only allowed a single\n                    accelerometer/gyro. We worked in teams of three, and I was again tasked with designing and fabricating the robot body. Additionally we all\n                    ended up writing separate balancing algorithms since the problem turned out to be rather intractable.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    As it turned out, the motor we were provided for the robot was actually not quite strong enough for the task&mdash;it lacked sufficient\n                    torque to drive the system away from perturbations back to equilibrium&mdash;so no one in the class was successful in getting their robot to\n                    balance for arbitrarily long. To combat this on our robot, I added a balance beam to the robot which allowed us to maximize the robot&apos;s\n                    moment of inertia along the balance axis. Ultimately, the longest we managed to get it to balance for was the 20 seconds shown in the video\n                    below.\n                </p>\n                <Grid columns={2}>\n                    <Grid.Column>\n                        <Grid.Row>\n                            <Collage imageSrcs={balancer_imageSrcs} />\n                        </Grid.Row>\n                    </Grid.Column>\n                    <Grid.Column>\n                        <Grid.Row>\n                            <YouTube videoId=\"iOoxCsl8L_c\" opts={{ width: '100%', height: '502px' }} />\n                        </Grid.Row>\n                    </Grid.Column>\n                </Grid>\n                <h3>Hockey Robots</h3>\n                <p>\n                    The capstone project for the course involved building two robots to autonomously play hockey against another pair of robots. For this\n                    project, I worked on a team of three, where I again was mainly tasked with designing and fabricating the robots. For the hockey match, each\n                    team was to build a goalie robot, and a striker robot. The design constraints were pretty flexible, mainly just limiting the size of the\n                    robots. Ultimately due to time constraints, the actual hockey tournament was cancelled, but my team&apos;s robots turned out quite well,\n                    especially the striker.\n                </p>\n                <h4>Goalie</h4>\n                <Collage imageSrcs={jhockey_goalie_imageSrcs} />\n                <br />\n                <p>\n                    The goalie is relatively simple. Its main strategy is to simply drive back and forth in front of the goal, and extend an inner panel for\n                    extra reach. It uses the same tread drive as the striker, but in a triangular pattern, mainly to accommodate having a large gear in the\n                    single-stage reduction from the motors (and definitely not because it made it look more like WALL-E).\n                </p>\n                <h4>Striker</h4>\n                <Collage imageSrcs={jhockey_striker_imageSrcs} />\n                <br />\n                <p>\n                    The striker was built with considerations for several mistakes that cropped up while building the goalie robot. While more complicated than\n                    the goalie&apos;s drive train, the striker used a five-stage gear reduction. This allowed it to fit entirely inside the body, while also\n                    providing much more precise control over the speeds available to the robot. The striker also has a quite simple shooting mechanism. A spring\n                    loaded pusher plate is stretched back via an archimedes spiral.

My team of 3 attempted to create a deep learning based choral music synthesizer. Since singing voice synthesizers were (and\n                    still are) a relatively unexplored area of machine learning, we each decided to apply separate ML architectures to our problem&mdash;I chose\n                    to focus on the WaveNet architecture.\n                </p>\n                <h3>WaveNet</h3>\n                <p>\n                    At the time, the state of the art in pure speech synthesis was Google&apos;s WaveNet architecture, used extensively by their Google\n                    Assistant. The{' '}\n                    <ExternalLink href=\"https://deepmind.com/blog/article/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio\">DeepMind blog post about WaveNets</ExternalLink>{' '}\n                    does a really great job illustrating how they work, but at a high level, WaveNets are a type of convolutional network which seeks to\n                    directly model the distribution of real audio. WaveNets generates audio one sample at a time, and make use of a special type of so-called\n                    dilated convolution which allows the architecture to simultaneously handle both small scale and large scale details present in audio data.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    The specific implementation of WaveNet I used was the <ExternalLink href=\"https://github.com/NVIDIA/nv-wavenet\">nv-wavenet</ExternalLink> by\n                    Nvidia, which included several optimizations allowing for much faster audio synthesis. The final speech synthesis architecture looked very\n                    similar to their <ExternalLink href=\"https://github.com/NVIDIA/tacotron2\">Tacotron2</ExternalLink> architecture, consisting of a WaveNet\n                    trained to generate audio from spectrograms, and a transformer trained to generate spectrograms given audio features&mdash;In their case the\n                    transformer converts text to spectrograms, while mine converts from features like pitch, volume, vowel, singer, etc.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    For the application of choir synthesis, we found the <ExternalLink href=\"https://zenodo.org/record/1193957\">VocalSet dataset</ExternalLink>{' '}\n                    which consists of 10 hours of monophonic singing by 20 singers. The data mostly consists of various scales and arpeggios sung on the vowels\n                    &apos;a&apos;, &apos;e&apos;, &apos;i&apos;, &apos;o&apos;, and &apos;u&apos;, along with several other vocal techniques. To train the\n                    WaveNet, I pulled out just the normal scales sung on each of the vowels, and had the WaveNet learn to reconstruct the raw audio given a\n                    spectrogram. I then built a simple transformer network which would generate spectrograms for the WaveNet. The features used by the\n                    transformer were either provided by the dataset itself (namely singer, and vowel), or were generated by analyzing the audio (pitch detection\n                    for pitch, and mean absolute value for volume).\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    For the last piece of my solution, I pulled in the work I had done during a{' '}\n                    <InternalLink to=\"/projects/ensemble_peabody\">recent hackathon</InternalLink>, in which I had built a simple MusicXML parsing engine.

Ultimately, a mostly vanilla WaveNet isn&apos;t suited for singing voice synthesis due to several assumptions made about spoken voice,\n                    namely that the dynamic range of pitches a spoken voice experiences is relatively small. The spectrograms used as feature input to the\n                    WaveNet do not possess a suitable range of frequencies for singing applications, and increasing the range runs into issues of not enough\n                    resolution, or too much memory used by the model.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    Moving forward, I have continued to work on the problem of choral voice synthesis, and am starting to make good progress in my{' '}\n                    <InternalLink to=\"/projects/so_voice\">so voice!</InternalLink> project.

I\n                    joined the Paul Reed Smith (PRS) team near the end of the project, and developed the entire software suite for running their automatic fret\n                    press robot.\n                </p>\n                <h3>Background</h3>\n                <p>\n                    <ExternalLink href=\"https://prsguitars.com/\">Paul Reed Smith Guitars</ExternalLink> manufactures guitars largely by hand, making use of\n                    automated techniques when it is possible to maintain quality. One particular process they were interested in automating was that of gluing\n                    and pressing frets into the guitar neck&mdash;for each fret, a precise quantity of glue needs to be laid down in the fret slot, followed by\n                    placing and then pressing a fret on top. The task itself is somewhat intricate, but also incredibly repetitive, leading to burnout among\n                    employees performing it.\n                </p>\n                <YouTube videoId=\"odeBP5sQw2I\" opts={{ width: '100%' }} />\n                <br />\n                <p>\n                    In 2018, PRS sponsored a JHU Senior Design team to design and build a robot for automating the process. Ultimately the scope of the project\n                    was too much to be completed in a single year, so PRS extended the project into 2019, and JHU Mechanical Engineering had a small team of\n                    Master&apos;s students take over its completion. I joined the Master&apos;s team during the final semester of the project, and was tasked\n                    with writing the entirety of the software needed to control and operate the robot.\n                </p>\n                <h3>Robot Design</h3>\n                <Collage imageSrcs={imageSrcs} />\n                <h3>Technical</h3>\n                <p>\n                    The main features of the robot include the sliding fret board platform, the glue arm, the presser mechanism, and the laser fret slot sensor.\n                    It is all controlled by a single Arduino Mega, which monitors the various sensors and controls the stepper motors and pneumatics. To press\n                    the frets, the robot performs the following steps:\n                    <ol>\n                        <li>Measure the slot location by sliding the fret board in front of the laser</li>\n                        <li>Move the fret board to align the slot with the glue arm</li>\n                        <li>Swing the glue arm towards the fret board</li>\n                        <li>When the glue arm reaches the start of the fret board, activate the pneumatic valve to dispense glue</li>\n                        <li>When the glue arm reaches the end of the fret board, deactivate the glue valve</li>\n                        <li>Move the fret board so that the glue arm aligns with the next slot</li>\n                        <li>Repeat the glue process, reversing the motion of the glue arm, towards its original position</li>\n                        <li>Move the fret board so that the slot aligns with the press mechanism</li>\n                        <li>Swing the press mechanism over top of the fret board</li>\n                        <li>Activate the pneumatic dropping the press mechanism and fret wire into the slot</li>\n                        <li>Retract the press mechanism (this unspools fret wire for the next slot)</li>\n                        <li>Activate the pneumatics to close the snippers, and cut the fret wire</li>\n                        <li>Deactivate the pneumatics to open the snippers</li>\n                        <li>Repeat the above steps for the rest of the frets on the fret board</li>\n                    </ol>\n                </p>\n                <h3>Software</h3>\n                <p>\n                    To control the robot, I developed a C++ driver program, and a number of support modules. For development and debugging, the code makes\n                    extensive use of the Arduino&apos;s serial communication capabilities&mdash;keywords with optional parameters can be sent to the robot to\n                    instruct it to perform any of its possible operations (e.g. jog the fret board platform to a certain location, activate a specific pneumatic\n                    valve, measure the laser intensity, etc.). For normal operations, I wrote modules to provide convenient interfaces for each component of the\n                    robot, including low level components like stepper motors, limit switches, pneumatics, and also higher level components, like the glue arm,\n                    or presser subassemblies. To start the fret press sequence, an operator simply loads a fret board onto the robot, and then presses the two\n                    start buttons, kicking off a software sequence that runs each of the steps listed above for pressing frets.\n                </p>\n                <h3>Laser Fret Detector</h3>\n                <p>\n                    In addition to software work, I also helped develop solutions for several mechanical and electrical issues facing the project. In\n                    particular, I developed the laser system for accurately measuring the precise location of each fret on the fret board. The robot uses the\n                    fret locations to know where to move the fret board so that it exactly lines up with the glue arm, as well as the press mechanism. The\n                    detector works by shining a laser across the path of the fret board. As the board passes in front of the laser, it occludes the beam from\n                    the detector. When a slot passes in front of the beam, some of the laser light is allowed through, which is picked up by a photodiode on the\n                    other side of the machine. In software, the peaks in brightness are then correlated with the step count from the stepper motor, indicating\n                    precisely where each fret is relative to the robot.\n                </p>\n                <h3>Videos</h3>\n                <Grid columns={3}>\n                    <Grid.Column>\n                        <Grid.Row>\n                            <img src={laser} style={{ width: '100%' }} />\n                            <p>Laser fret slot detection system</p>\n                        </Grid.Row>\n                    </Grid.Column>\n                    <Grid.Column>\n                        <Grid.Row>\n                            <img src={glue} style={{ width: '100%' }} />\n                            <p>Glue dispensing mechanism</p>\n                        </Grid.Row>\n                    </Grid.Column>\n\n                    <Grid.Column>\n                        <Grid.Row>\n                            <img src={press} style={{ width: '100%' }} />\n                            <p>Fret press mechanism</p>\n                        </Grid.Row>\n                    </Grid.Column>\n                </Grid>\n                <br />\n                <YouTube videoId=\"1CZEYDhc4wY\" opts={{ width: '100%' }} />\n                <h3>Links</h3>\n                <List>\n                    <List.Item>\n                        <span>\n                            <Icon name=\"github\" size=\"big\" />\n                            <ExternalLink href=\"https://github.com/david-andrew/PRS_robot\">Github Repo</ExternalLink>\n                        </span>\n                    </List.Item>\n                </List>\n            </PageContainer>\n        </>\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react'\nimport { PageContainer, PageHeading } from '../../Components'\n\nexport const RebelScum = (): JSX.Element => {\n    return (\n        <>\n            <PageContainer>\n                <PageHeading title=\"Rebel Scum High Power Rocket\" subtitle=\"\" />\n                <h3>Coming Soon</h3>\n            </PageContainer>\n        </>\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react'\nimport { PageContainer, PageHeading } from '../../Components'\n\nexport const Rewind = (): JSX.Element => {\n    return (\n        <>\n            <PageContainer>\n                <PageHeading title=\"Rewind\" subtitle=\"\" />\n                <h3>Coming Soon</h3>\n            </PageContainer>\n        </>\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react'\nimport { PageContainer, PageHeading } from '../../Components'\n\nexport const RoboJay = (): JSX.Element => {\n    return (\n        <>\n            <PageContainer>\n                <PageHeading title=\"RoboJay\" subtitle=\"\" />\n                <h3>Coming Soon</h3>\n            </PageContainer>\n        </>\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react'\nimport { PageContainer, PageHeading } from '../../Components'\n\nexport const SpaceportAmericaCup = (): JSX.Element => {\n    return (\n        <>\n            <PageContainer>\n                <PageHeading title=\"Spaceport America Cup 2018\" subtitle=\"\" />\n                <h3>Coming Soon</h3>\n            </PageContainer>\n        </>\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react'\nimport { Icon } from 'semantic-ui-react'\nimport { PageContainer, PageHeading } from '../../Components'\nimport { ExternalLink } from '../../utilities'\nimport { useGithubTimestamp } from '../../utilities'\n\nexport const SkipSpoilers = (): JSX.Element => {\n    //get the timestamp subtitle\n    const subtitle = useGithubTimestamp('uSkipSpoilers')\n\n    return (\n        <>\n            <PageContainer>\n                <PageHeading title=\"uSkipSpoilers\" subtitle={subtitle} />\n                <p>\n                    uSkipSpoilers is a small chrome extension I made mostly as a joke for my brother who is extremely spoiler averse.

Spoiler boundaries are saved to the video URL which can then be easily shared with someone else who has the\n                    extension. So for example, say I want to send a youtube video to my brother about a something, but I notice it contains spoilers for a movie\n                    he is planning to watch, I can annotate the spoiler timestamps in the extension, and then send the custom link with the annotations, and\n                    then he can watch without worry.\n                </p>\n                <h3>Try It</h3>\n                <span>\n                    <Icon name=\"chrome\" size=\"big\" />\n                    <ExternalLink href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/uskipspoilers/gahcifkbhfpglehmpapbhcafiailckcd\">\n                        uSkipSpoilers Chrome Extension\n                    </ExternalLink>\n                </span>\n                <h3>Github</h3>\n                <span>\n                    <Icon name=\"github\" size=\"big\" />\n                    <ExternalLink href=\"https://github.com/david-andrew/uSkipSpoilers\">uSkipSpoilers git repo</ExternalLink>\n                </span>\n            </PageContainer>\n        </>\n    )\n}\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/architecture.c1790484.png\";","import React from 'react'\nimport { PageContainer, PageHeading, Collage } from '../../Components'\nimport { List, Icon } from 'semantic-ui-react'\nimport { ExternalLink } from '../../utilities'\nimport YouTube from 'react-youtube'\nimport architecture from '../../images/wse18/architecture.png'\n\nexport const WSE18 = (): JSX.Element => {\n    const gatekeeper_r = require.context('../../images/wse18/gatekeeper')\n    const gatekeeper_imageSrcs = gatekeeper_r.keys().map((path: string) => gatekeeper_r(path).default) as string[]\n\n    const kiosk_r = require.context('../../images/wse18/kiosk')\n    const kiosk_imageSrcs = kiosk_r.keys().map((path: string) => kiosk_r(path).default) as string[]\n\n    const promo_r = require.context('../../images/wse18/promo')\n    const promo_imageSrcs = promo_r.keys().map((path: string) => promo_r(path).default) as string[]\n\n    return (\n        <>\n            <PageContainer>\n                <PageHeading title=\"WSE18: Machine Shop Biometric Interlock\" subtitle=\"\" />\n                <p>\n                    At the end of the Mechanical Engineering program at JHU, students participate in Senior Design, a final, year-long capstone project where\n                    they apply all of the tools and skills they&apos;ve learned to real world problems, sponsored by real companies. My team of three developed\n                    a biometric access and security system for our sponsor, the JHU WSE machine shop.\n                </p>\n                <h3>Background</h3>\n                <p>\n                    The Whiting School provides a student machine shop with various machines, such as lathes, mills, wire EDM, etc. for use by various labs and\n                    departments around campus. Students with proper safety training, and access to a valid budget may use the machine shop for school and\n                    research projects. It goes without saying that a machine shop is quite a dangerous facility, especially for people who lack proper training\n                    for each piece of equipment. Historically the WSE machine shop operated on the honor system&mdash;students would participate in a short\n                    training course for each piece of equipment, and then after each use of a machine, fill out a form indicating which machine, how long, and\n                    which budget to charge. The system was frequently abused, with both untrained students operating machines, in addition to individuals\n                    &apos;forgetting&apos; to charge their machine time. So in order to mitigate these issued, the machine shop tasked my team to devise an\n                    interlock system for controlling access to machines, and automatically billing usage.\n                </p>\n                <YouTube videoId=\"rs2gCPOII2A\" opts={{ width: '100%' }} />\n                <h3>Solution Overview</h3>\n                <p>\n                    My team&apos;s solutions seeks to solve the following problem: Ensure that people operating machines in the machine shop have the proper\n                    training, and ensure that all machine usage is properly billed. To solve this, we developed a software controlled interlock system that uses\n                    fingerprint biometrics to track who is using what machines.\n                </p>\n                <img src={architecture} style={{ width: '100%' }} />\n                <p>\n                    To use a machine, a user must verify their identity by scanning their fingerprint. The system then checks a database to ensure the user\n                    possesses the proper training for the machine they are accessing. If the user is trained, they then can select one of their valid budgets to\n                    bill. Once these steps are complete, the system then unlocks the machine by activating a power relay which connects the machine to main\n                    power. The user then uses the machine, and when they are finished, the system locks the machine and logs the amount of time to bill the user\n                    for.\n                </p>\n                <h3>Why Fingerprints</h3>\n                <p>\n                    For this specific problem, there are several compounding factors that led us to choose fingerprint biometrics for user verification. In\n                    general, when trying to verify an individual&apos;s identity, typically there are three types of credentials you can use:\n                    <ol>\n                        <li>Something only you &quot;know&quot;, e.g. a password, answer to a security question, etc.</li>\n                        <li>Something only you &quot;have&quot;, e.g. a physical key, a cell phone, an ID card, etc.</li>\n                        <li>Something only you &quot;are&quot;, i.e. unique biometric signatures such as a fingerprint, face scan, handwriting, dna, etc.</li>\n                    </ol>\n                    For many systems, the first two are often adequate to confidently verify user identity. For example, to log into a bank account with\n                    2-factor authentication (2FA), a user will enter their password, which only they know, and then enter a code generated on their phone which\n                    verifies that they have a unique object, i.e. their phone. When presented with these secure identifiers, the bank can be sure of the\n                    user&apos;s identity, and unlock their account.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    For our system however, the first two forms of identification are not adequate, because our users are prone to behave in an adversarial way\n                    towards our system. For a bank password/2FA code, both the bank and the user want to ensure that it is only the user that has access to the\n                    bank account&mdash;i.e. users don&apos;t want their password to be stolen. In the machine shop though, a common situation is one where a\n                    campus club or design team (e.g. Baja SAE, Rocketry, JHU ASME, etc.) might compel members to perform a task on a machine they are not\n                    trained, due to time crunch. In this situation, trained members who possess any hypothetical credentials would be incentivised to give them\n                    away to the untrained members. Historically, keycard access was required to enter the machine shop, and trained club members would\n                    frequently give their access card to untrained members, so that a task could be completed more quickly.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    To solve this issue of potentially adversarial users, we chose to authenticate via biometrics, which are not easily transferable to other\n                    individuals&mdash;an individual cannot easily &quot;give&quot; someone else their fingerprint, facial features, their iris pattern, etc.,\n                    which makes them quite an attractive option to ensure that the user is always who they say they are. An added benefit for the user is that\n                    biometrics are seamless&mdash;no passwords to remember, and no special ID cards to bring everywhere.\n                </p>\n                <h3>Gatekeeper UI</h3>\n                <p>\n                    In order to make the system as seamless as possible, I developed a custom touch screen user interface. The UI was written in Qt, and runs on\n                    a so-called Gatekeeper&mdash;A Raspberry Pi connected to the interlock mechanism that controls the whole system. The Gatekeeper UI allows a\n                    user to select a budget to bill machine usage, as well as providing useful feedback and messages during the session.\n                </p>\n                <Collage imageSrcs={gatekeeper_imageSrcs} rowSizes={[3, 3]} />\n                <h3>Kiosk UI</h3>\n                <p>\n                    Additionally I developed a companion UI to run the kiosk system, used to register new users into the system. The kiosk provides also\n                    provides many administrative functions for the system, such as adding and modifying budgets, machines, and users in the system.\n                </p>\n                <Collage imageSrcs={kiosk_imageSrcs} rowSizes={[4]} />\n                <h3>Back End</h3>\n                <p>\n                    In addition to the user facing UI and Gatekeeper, I supported the development of several back end components of the system. When a user\n                    scans their finger at a gatekeeper, the gatekeeper connects over a network to a server which provides records of which fingerprints match to\n                    which users, as well as budgets, machine authorization, etc. possessed by the user. The back end is written in python, and is split into two\n                    parts: a host running on a university maintained server, and a client running on each gatekeeper and kiosk connected to the system. The host\n                    serves a SQLite database, in addition to performing several bookkeeping tasks such as emailing admins a monthly billing report, recording\n                    incidents (e.g. failed login attempts), and emailing admins a new system override code at the start of each week. The client manages all\n                    non-UI related tasks, mainly managing the fingerprint matching process, and controlling all connected peripherals, like the interlock relay,\n                    and machine usage monitoring sensors.\n                </p>\n                <h3>Pictures</h3>\n                <Collage imageSrcs={promo_imageSrcs} />\n                <p>Shots of one of several Gatekeepers installed in the machine shop, as well as the kiosk system.</p>\n                <h3>Live Demo</h3>\n                <YouTube videoId=\"iTQsDDEW6qs\" opts={{ width: '100%' }} />\n                <p>\n                    User logging in and unlocking a machine. Note that the long duration of processing after scanning the fingerprint was updated in a later\n                    version.\n                </p>\n                <h3>Documents</h3>\n
