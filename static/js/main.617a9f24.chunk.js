In the machine shop though, a common situation is one where a campus club or design team (e.g. Baja SAE, Rocketry, JHU ASME, etc.) might compel members to perform a task on a machine they are not trained, due to time crunch. In this situation, trained members who possess any hypothetical credentials would be incentivised to give them away to the untrained members. Historically, keycard access was required to enter the machine shop, and trained club members would frequently give their access card to untrained members, so that a task could be completed more quickly."}),Object(d.jsx)("p",{children:'To solve this issue of potentially adversarial users, we chose to authenticate via biometrics, which are not easily transferable to other individuals\u2014an individual cannot easily "give" someone else their fingerprint, facial features, their iris pattern, etc., which makes them quite an attractive option to ensure that the user is always who they say they are.

The back end is written in python, and is split into two parts: a host running on a university maintained server, and a client running on each gatekeeper and kiosk connected to the system. The host serves a SQLite database, in addition to performing several bookkeeping tasks such as emailing admins a monthly billing report, recording incidents (e.g. failed login attempts), and emailing admins a new system override code at the start of each week.

Additionally the other interesting feature is that of slow bouncing bullets. Each bullet the characters shoot is physically simulated, flies at a relatively slow (but visibly fast) velocity, and has a highly visible mesh. This gives a really interesting style to them, and makes them almost feel like tracer rounds as they fly across the map.
