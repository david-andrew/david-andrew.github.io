At IDT, I focused on both machine learning, and front end development. Of note, I designed a novel machine learning architecture for\n                efficiently allocating compute resources to minimize the execution time of High Level Architecture (HLA) federated simulations. I also\n                implemented a custom time series anomaly detection ensemble model in Julia, and developed the React UI for visualizing the results.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                During my master&apos;s coursework I implemented a variety of ML algorithms from scratch, including MLP, SVM, Expectation Maximization, PCA,\n                autoencoding, and autocorrelation/cross-correlation. Additionally, I&apos;ve worked with CNNs, VGG, ResNet, U-net, Viola Jones, and a variety of\n                other architectures. For a <InternalLink to=\"/projects/musical_dl\">capstone project</InternalLink> I developed a novel architecture that\n                leveraged the WaveNet vocoder model paired with a custom convolutional transformer network to create a realistic choral voice synthesizer. Prior\n                to that, at an internship with the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab (JHUAPL), I worked on machine learning capabilities for controlling a\n                robotic limb by analyzing electromyogram (EMG) signals in an individual&apos;s upper arm.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                For my undergraduate coursework, I mainly focused on mechanical design, and pure software development.

Ultimately, building a\n                    completely accurate simulation was a bit beyond my Unity skills, but, with some suggestions from family, I did end up with a fun little\n                    meditative experience.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    The player controls a small boat sailing along an endless ocean under a starry sky. John Tavener&apos;s Song for Athene provides an ethereal\n                    soundscape for the dreamlike scene. The entire game lasts for about 7 minutes, with the boat picking up speed towards the climax of the\n                    song, and ultimately taking off for the great beyond.\n                </p>\n                <h3>Photos</h3>\n                <Collage imageSrcs={imageSrcs} rowSizes={[1, 2, 3]} />\n                <h3>Try It</h3>\n                <List>\n                    <List.Item>\n                        <span>\n                            <Icon name=\"windows\" size=\"big\" />\n                            <ExternalLink href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/95v6y2a4zgls45y/Build11_Windows_64_bit.zip?dl=0\">\n                                Boat Simulator Build 11\n                            </ExternalLink>\n                        </span>\n                    </List.Item>\n                    <List.Item>\n                        <span>\n                            <Icon name=\"apple\" size=\"big\" />\n                            Recommend using <ExternalLink href=\"https://www.winehq.org/\">Wine</ExternalLink>\n                        </span>\n                    </List.Item>\n                    <List.Item>\n                        <span>\n                            <Icon name=\"linux\" size=\"big\" />\n                            Recommend using <ExternalLink href=\"https://www.winehq.org/\">Wine</ExternalLink>\n                        </span>\n                    </List.Item>\n                </List>\n            </PageContainer>\n        </>\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react'\nimport { PageContainer, PageHeading } from '../../Components'\nimport YouTube from 'react-youtube'\n\nexport const BuellerBoard = (): JSX.Element => {\n    return (\n        <>\n            <PageContainer>\n                <PageHeading />\n                <h3>About</h3>\n                <p>\n                    In fall 2015 I attended my first hackathon. With a team of 3, we built a very simple app that allowed you to use custom sounds for a midi\n                    keyboard. The app itself is a just a simple webpage with a virtual keyboard, and options to upload your audio file. Additionally the app can\n                    playback midi files, leading to much hilarity. My role mainly consisted of handling the music side of the project, e.g. generating suitable\n                    midi files, figuring out how to handle pitch shifting, etc., while my teammates focused on building the app and intefaces.\n                    <br />\n                    <br />\n                    While quite silly, our project actually ended up winning a prize for crowd favorite.\n                </p>\n                <h3>HopHacks Demo</h3>\n                <YouTube videoId=\"rpgYMfEShjQ\" opts={{ width: '100%' }} />\n            </PageContainer>\n        </>\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react'\nimport { PageContainer, PageHeading } from '../../Components'\nimport { ExternalLink } from '../../utilities'\n\nexport const Composer = (): JSX.Element => {\n    return (\n        <>\n            <PageContainer>\n                <PageHeading />\n                <p>\n                    Composer is a web-based music entry application I am developing with my brother.

The main goal is to build a language that has the exact feature\n                    set that I&apos;ve always wished existed. Dewy is a general purpose language with a focus on scientific and engineering applications.

The next steps are to add some missing features to the parser, write out the language\n                    Context Free Grammar (CFG) in the meta-language, implement the parser back ends (LLVM and C) for generating code from the parse tree, and\n                    then build out the standard library.\n                </p>\n                <h3>Parsing</h3>\n                <p>\n                    All programming languages start with a compiler, which itself is made of several parts, namely: lexing, parsing, semantic analysis, and code\n                    generation. Dewy makes use of a SRNGLR parser which allows the lexing and parsing phases be combined into a single step.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    To parse a mathematical expression like <Code>1 + 2 * 3</Code> we first have to define the grammar for how raw text gets converted to a\n                    parse tree. For this, I&apos;ve developed the Dewy Meta Language which allows for the specification of any Context Free Grammar (CFG), as\n                    well as some context sensitive grammars which can be parsed by SRNGLR. Additionally, the meta-language / parser are optimized to allow for\n                    arbitrary unicode characters as part of the language alphabet, whereas parsers are often limited a much smaller alphabet, e.g. ASCII.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    Normally a grammar must be unambiguous to work with standard LR, LALR, etc. parsers. This complicates the process of writing the grammar, as\n                    often times, the natural way to express a language will be ambiguous, and require careful work to disambiguate. For the math expression{' '}\n                    <Code>1 + 2 * 3</Code>, or any other math expression, the unambiguous version of the grammar might look like this:\n                </p>\n                <CodeBlock flatten text={unambiguousExpressionGrammar.grammar} />\n                <p>\n                    Precedence is handled by restricting which expressions can be subexpressions, using different grammar symbols. Associativity is also handled\n                    in a similar fashion, namely the left or right hand side is restricted to specific subexpression types that generate the correct\n                    associativity. Ultimately though, because SRNGLR can handle ambiguities, the grammar can be simplified to something like this:\n                </p>\n                <CodeBlock flatten text={ambiguousExpressionGrammar.grammar} />\n                <p>\n                    Note that for the ambiguous grammar, precedence and associativity still need to be handled at some point in the process.

The parse trees need to be analyzed to ensure that they\n                    follow the languages semantics, e.g. variables may only be referenced when in scope, function calls have the same number of arguments as\n                    their definitions, type safety checks, etc.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    After semantic analysis, the last step of the compiler is code generation.

But at\n                    a high level, so voice! consists of two main parts: the parsing engine, and the synthesizer. The parsing engine reads in sheet music,\n                    currently from well formed (read curated) MusicXML files, and converts them to a serial representation that can be fed into a machine\n                    learning pipeline. The synthesizer then pipes that representation through a series of deep learning models which ultimately output an audio\n                    file that is the synthesized performance of the input. Eventually I&apos;d also like to add in a machine learning pipeline for reading sheet\n                    music from images (e.g. PDFs).\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    In terms of the actual machine learning pipeline, I have been developing custom architectures ever since I started working on the project in\n                    early 2019. Initially I centered my design around the WaveNet, which Google uses to great effect for their Text-to-Speech service, however\n                    several compounding factors cause WaveNets to be unsuitable for choral voice synthesis, e.g. difficulty parallelizing, low output sample\n                    rates, small pitch range, etc. More recently a <ExternalLink href=\"https://magenta.tensorflow.org/ddsp\">article/paper</ExternalLink> by\n                    project magenta has piqued my interest, and I have since developed several prototype differentiable synthesizer networks that leverage those\n                    techniques. I&apos;m also very interested in experimenting with transformers, which I think have good prospects to work well in the\n                    pipelines I&apos;ve been building.\n                </p>\n                <h3>Current Example</h3>\n                <p>\n                    This demonstrates the final step in the pipeline which generates audio given output from all the previous steps.

After much\n                    brainstorming, we landed on the concept of sheep herding, where you control sheep dogs, and have to guide non-cooperative sheep away from\n                    danger, and towards the goal. And to make it feel extra <em>out of control</em>, we gave the player simultaneous control of 4 dogs. As the\n                    player progresses, obstacles become more difficult to manuever around, and adversarial wolves show up and attempt to eat the sheep.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    Early on, I decided that we would make the game in the Godot game engine&mdash;I was turned off of Unity3D from{' '}\n                    <InternalLink to=\"/projects/boat_simulator\">past</InternalLink> <InternalLink to=\"/projects/rewind\">experiences</InternalLink> with it, and\n                    had been hearing only good things about the new Godot engine. For the game jam, my brother handled all art related aspects (sprites,\n                    backgrounds, music, sound effects, etc.), while I handled coding the game itself. Mechanically the game is super simple: sheep use the{' '}\n                    <ExternalLink href=\"https://eater.net/boids\">Boids Algorithm</ExternalLink> to wander around the screen, while each of the player controlled\n                    dogs exert a repulsive force on nearby sheep. The enemy wolf AI is literally just{' '}\n                    <em>walk in a circle until a sheep is nearby, and then chase/attempt to eat it</em>.

Players play as a physically simulated cube that can run around the map and shoot a rifle. The\n                    player physics are much less realistic and more akin to the floaty jumping and movement one might find in a Mario game&mdash;this actually\n                    felt surprisingly fun to play on the test level. Additionally the other interesting feature is that of slow bouncing bullets. Each bullet\n                    the characters shoot is physically simulated, flies at a relatively slow (but visibly fast) velocity, and has a highly visible mesh. This\n                    gives a really interesting style to them, and makes them almost feel like tracer rounds as they fly across the map. While implementing the\n                    bullet physics, I happened to set them to bounce off of surfaces, which introduced the very fun concept of bouncing bullets.\n                </p>\n                <Collage imageSrcs={imageSrcs} />\n                <p>\n                    With just these few mechanics on a test level, the demo is still quite fun to mess around with (especially bouncing bullets off of various\n                    surfaces).

For sensors, we were allowed a single{' '}\n                    <ExternalLink href=\"https://pixycam.com/pixy-cmucam5/\">PixyCam</ExternalLink>, an ultrasonic depth sensor, and a pair of flexible\n                    deformation sensors. For this robot, I was on a team with two other people. My responsibilities consisted of designing and fabricating the\n                    chassis, while they focused on programming the robot. To solve the maze, the robot may use any algorithm, as well as use the colored square\n                    hints placed throughout the maze.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    An interesting feature of the chassis design is that it was design to fit together using nothing but friction joints. This means that each\n                    joint is slightly larger than where it is supposed to fit, and the interference between both sides holds the parts together&mdash;no glue\n                    was needed, and the only fasteners were to hold components to the body. Normally, laser cut acrylic isn&apos;t cut with such tight\n                    tolerances, but with a little bit of experimentation, I was able to get it to work quite nicely.\n                </p>\n                <Grid columns={2}>\n                    <Grid.Column>\n                        <Grid.Row>\n                            <Collage imageSrcs={mazeSolver_imageSrcs} />\n                        </Grid.Row>\n                    </Grid.Column>\n                    <Grid.Column>\n                        <Grid.Row>\n                            <YouTube videoId=\"_ZzZNforl5k\" opts={{ width: '100%', height: '753px' }} />\n                        </Grid.Row>\n                    </Grid.Column>\n                </Grid>\n                <h3>Balancing Robot</h3>\n                <p>\n                    The second robot we built was a robot designed to balance along a single axis. For sensors, we were only allowed a single\n                    accelerometer/gyro. We worked in teams of three, and I was again tasked with designing and fabricating the robot body. Additionally we all\n                    ended up writing separate balancing algorithms since the problem turned out to be rather intractable.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    As it turned out, the motor we were provided for the robot was actually not quite strong enough for the task&mdash;it lacked sufficient\n                    torque to drive the system away from perturbations back to equilibrium&mdash;so no one in the class was successful in getting their robot to\n                    balance for arbitrarily long. To combat this on our robot, I added a balance beam to the robot which allowed us to maximize the robot&apos;s\n                    moment of inertia along the balance axis. Ultimately, the longest we managed to get it to balance for was the 20 seconds shown in the video\n                    below.\n                </p>\n                <Grid columns={2}>\n                    <Grid.Column>\n                        <Grid.Row>\n                            <Collage imageSrcs={balancer_imageSrcs} />\n                        </Grid.Row>\n                    </Grid.Column>\n                    <Grid.Column>\n                        <Grid.Row>\n                            <YouTube videoId=\"iOoxCsl8L_c\" opts={{ width: '100%', height: '502px' }} />\n                        </Grid.Row>\n                    </Grid.Column>\n                </Grid>\n                <h3>Hockey Robots</h3>\n                <p>\n                    The capstone project for the course involved building two robots to autonomously play hockey against another pair of robots. For this\n                    project, I worked on a team of three, where I again was mainly tasked with designing and fabricating the robots. For the hockey match, each\n                    team was to build a goalie robot, and a striker robot. The design constraints were pretty flexible, mainly just limiting the size of the\n                    robots. Ultimately due to time constraints, the actual hockey tournament was cancelled, but my team&apos;s robots turned out quite well,\n                    especially the striker.\n                </p>\n                <h4>Goalie</h4>\n                <Collage imageSrcs={jhockey_goalie_imageSrcs} />\n                <p>\n                    The goalie is relatively simple. Its main strategy is to simply drive back and forth in front of the goal, and extend an inner panel for\n                    extra reach. It uses the same tread drive as the striker, but in a triangular pattern, mainly to accommodate having a large gear in the\n                    single-stage reduction from the motors (and definitely not because it made it look more like WALL-E).\n                </p>\n                <h4>Striker</h4>\n                <Collage imageSrcs={jhockey_striker_imageSrcs} />\n                <p>\n                    The striker was built with considerations for several mistakes that cropped up while building the goalie robot. While more complicated than\n                    the goalie&apos;s drive train, the striker used a five-stage gear reduction. This allowed it to fit entirely inside the body, while also\n                    providing much more precise control over the speeds available to the robot. The striker also has a quite simple shooting mechanism. A spring\n                    loaded pusher plate is stretched back via an archimedes spiral. A limit switch detects when the plate is fully retracted, and then the\n                    spiral is rotated just a few more degrees to release the pusher plate. To shoot again, the spiral just needs to continue rotating in the\n                    same direction.\n                </p>\n                <Grid columns={2}>\n                    <Grid.Column>\n                        <Grid.Row>\n                            <img src={goalie_moving} style={{ width: '100%' }} />\n                            <p>Simple clip of the goalie robot driving (via remote control) while powered by a bench power supply</p>\n                        </Grid.Row>\n                    </Grid.Column>\n                    <Grid.Column>\n                        <Grid.Row>\n                            <img src={striker_shooting} style={{ width: '100%' }} />\n                            <p>Demonstration of the striker shooting mechanism.

Also, probably almost certainly, my game is planned to take place in a wholly distinct\n                    universe, mainly to avoid any sort of IP infringement.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    At a high level, my game will be an open world third-person exploration sandbox. I&apos;m especially interested in making the world dynamic\n                    and giving the player agency to effect changes in the world. For instance countries around the map will all have simulated interactions both\n                    with each other, and their surrounding environment. Conflicts will evolve naturally based on situations where countries&apos; needs\n                    aren&apos;t being met, e.g. if there are food or resource shortages, and conflicts can escalate into wars. You as the player are free to act\n                    in the world&mdash;you can work to resolve conflict by helping countries secure their needs, or you could join the conflict yourself\n                    supporting a specific side, or you could ignore the conflict entirely and adventure off into other parts of the world. There will often be\n                    many conflicting interests and perspectives, with no single correct solution.\n                </p>\n                <h3>Systems/Mechanics</h3>\n                <h4>Third-person</h4>\n                <p>\n                    Much of the player&apos;s interaction with the game will be through a third-person character. I imagine this to be reminiscent of the open\n                    world from Zelda: Breath of the Wild, where there are many interesting locations to explore around the map, and the player is free to\n                    traverse and climb any part of it. Additionally, the player will be able to interact with NPCs which will draw from, and feed back into the\n                    country simulation mechanics, allowing your actions towards other characters in the game to affect the progression of local and world\n                    events.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    Another interesting piece for the third-person character is that I&apos;m planning to set up an AI based physical character controller. This\n                    means, instead of having a set of pre-canned animations that the character uses, the character&apos;s joints will be affect by physics, and\n                    the AI will command specific muscles to move such that the character does the desired action. A good example of this approach is explained\n                    in this <ExternalLink href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/K%C3%A1rolyZsolnai\">Two Minute Papers</ExternalLink> video:\n                </p>\n                <YouTube videoId=\"o_DhNqHazKY\" opts={{ width: '100%' }} />\n                <h4>Flying</h4>\n                <p>\n                    To travel quickly across large sections of the map, the player will have access to a variety of flying vehicles, starting with a glider\n                    similar to Nausicaa. Since flying will be an integral part of the game, it&apos;s the first component I set out to build. I wanted flying in\n                    the game to feel both enjoyable, but also grounded in reality, so I opted for a realistic flight model over a more arcade approach. Craft\n                    are subjected to a slightly idealized version of the real fluids equations governing flight, and then a simple flight controller algorithm\n                    assists with stabilization.\n                </p>\n                <Collage imageSrcs={imageSrcs} />\n                <p>\n                    I&apos;m super happy with how it turned out so far, and have definitely spent longer than I&apos;d like to admit just soaring around the\n                    simple test level I built&mdash;definitely a good sign for one of the core game mechanics.\n                </p>\n                <h4>Country/World Simulation</h4>\n                <p>\n                    To make the world feel more alive, and the player&apos;s actions more meaningful, I&apos;m planning to develop a world/country simulator for\n                    managing NPCs in the game. The idea is that there will be many countries and communities of people spread out around the world, and they\n                    will all have various needs and desires that they are trying to meet, including securing food and shelter, colonialism and political\n                    exploits, etc. In trying to accomplish their goals, countries can cooperate, or they may also come into conflict with each other. The player\n                    is then able to interact with characters under this system, and the results of the interaction then feed back into the simulation to produce\n                    some outcome.\n                </p>\n                <h4>Gardening</h4>\n                <p>\n                    The last mechanic I&apos;m envisioning is a sandbox garden that the player can tend to. I love the concept of a player adventuring out into\n                    the world, and bringing back different species of plants and flowers, which they then have the option to develop in their own garden, much\n                    like Nausicaa. From a mechanical point of view, I imagine this might be something simple like{' '}\n                    <ExternalLink href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system\">L-systems</ExternalLink> where different varieties of plants are procedurally\n                    generated, and seeded throughout the world for the player to find and collect.\n                </p>\n                <h3>Future Work</h3>\n                <p>\n                    For now, work on Mehve is on permanent hold due to lack of time.

WaveNets generate audio one sample at a time, and make use of a special type of so-called\n                    dilated convolution which allows the architecture to simultaneously handle both small scale and large scale details present in audio data.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    The specific implementation of WaveNet I used was the <ExternalLink href=\"https://github.com/NVIDIA/nv-wavenet\">nv-wavenet</ExternalLink> by\n                    Nvidia, which included several optimizations allowing for much faster audio synthesis.

I then built a simple transformer network which would generate spectrograms for the WaveNet.

Prior to my taking over of the\n                    project, the two previous teams that worked on it had made several small prototype components, but not much in the way of large scale\n                    progress. I took over the project in Fall 2018 when they graduated.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    For the most part, I built out each component of pOngBot by myself, as interest in (and time for) the project from club members seemed to be\n                    waning. Conceptually, pOngBot needs the following systems to operate: vision, a ball shooter, and an AI or decision making logic.\n                </p>\n                <h3>Vision</h3>\n                <p>\n                    The vision requirements for pOngBot are pretty straightforward&mdash;it just needs to be able to determine where cups are in 3D space so\n                    that it knows where to aim. Additionally, it would be useful to know where ping pong balls are, for a number of reasons, namely being able\n                    to determine when it is pOngBot&apos;s turn, and also as a tool for reinforcement learning.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    For an initial stab at localizing cup positions, I developed a system that leveraged the Viola-Jones algorithm, commonly used for face\n                    detection in photos/videos. My system was instead trained on many pictures of cups, and trained to place a bounding box around the opening\n                    section.\n                </p>\n                <Collage imageSrcs={cv_imageSrcs} rowSizes={[2, 2]} />\n                <p>\n                    The top two images show examples of data collected for the CV system, and the bottom two shows real time examples of the Viola-Jones\n                    algorithm operating. Notice that the Viola-Jones output captures all of the cups, but also is filled with many false positives. The original\n                    paper for face detection with Viola-Jones used about 100 times more data than I did for this particular iteration.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    From this point, the next steps in the vision system would be to implement 3D localization. At the moment, the algorithm simply marks where\n                    in the image a cup is identified, but those 2D image space coordinates need to be converted to 3D world space. This could potentially be\n                    solved with a single camera, by measuring the size of each cup opening (since they are the same size, differences in apparent size could be\n                    mapped to a z-coordinate), or potentially by using a stereo vision system with at least 2 cameras.\n                </p>\n                <h3>Shooter</h3>\n                <p>\n                    When I was president of the robotics club, the Robotics department at JHU donated to us a large amount of unused equipment&mdash;perfect for\n                    pOngBot was a gimbaling frame controlled by 2 stepper motors. Building off of the gimbal, I added a mount for a tube, which could be used to\n                    shoot ping pong balls with air. I also bought a commercial speaker stand, and fabricated a mount to attach the gimbal to the stand. For a\n                    simple demo of the aiming mechanism, I temporarily fastened on the electronics for running the steppers, and hooked up an arduino to control\n                    the system.\n                </p>\n                <Collage imageSrcs={gimbal_imageSrcs} />\n                <p>\n                    To shoot the ping pong balls, the plan was to use some sort of air pump with ducting up to the tube attached to the gimbal. Then ping pong\n                    balls could be shot simply by introducing them into the air stream. The particular air pump still needs to be worked out. I tried the\n                    smallest electric leaf blower I could find, but that ended up being way too powerful, so I&apos;m on the lookout for something even smaller.\n                </p>\n                <Grid columns={2}>\n                    <Grid.Column>\n                        <Grid.Row>\n                            <YouTube videoId=\"7YbrslKFqns\" opts={{ width: '100%' }} />\n                        </Grid.Row>\n                    </Grid.Column>\n                    <Grid.Column>\n                        <Grid.Row>\n                            <YouTube videoId=\"8hBZnOJ7Mzs\" opts={{ width: '100%' }} />\n                        </Grid.Row>\n                    </Grid.Column>\n                </Grid>\n                <h3>AI</h3>\n                <p>\n                    The AI system for pOngBot is intended to drive all high level actions the robot takes, such as taking a shot, waiting for the player to take\n                    a turn, etc. The system will take in information from the various sensors, and command the robot to take actions that are most likely to\n                    cause it to win the game. Work on the AI system will be started after a working prototype of the robot is ready. Initially the AI system\n                    will probably be a simple state based controller, but eventually, I plan to implement a form of reinforcement learning to train the robot to\n                    play as optimally as possible.\n                </p>\n                <h3>Future Work</h3>\n                <p>\n                    When I graduated, the club decided to donate pOngBot to me, mainly so it wouldn&apos;t sit around wasting limited club storage space.

One particular process they were interested in automating was that of gluing\n                    and pressing frets into the guitar neck&mdash;for each fret, a precise quantity of glue needs to be laid down in the fret slot, followed by\n                    placing and then pressing a fret on top. The task itself is somewhat intricate, but also incredibly repetitive, leading to burnout among\n                    employees performing it.\n                </p>\n                <YouTube videoId=\"odeBP5sQw2I\" opts={{ width: '100%' }} />\n                <br />\n                <p>\n                    In 2018, PRS sponsored a JHU Senior Design team to design and build a robot for automating the process. Ultimately the scope of the project\n                    was too much to be completed in a single year, so PRS extended the project into 2019, and JHU Mechanical Engineering had a small team of\n                    Master&apos;s students take over its completion. I joined the Master&apos;s team during the final semester of the project, and was tasked\n                    with writing the entirety of the software needed to control and operate the robot.\n                </p>\n                <h3>Robot Design</h3>\n                <Collage imageSrcs={imageSrcs} />\n                <h3>Technical</h3>\n                <p>\n                    The main features of the robot include the sliding fret board platform, the glue arm, the presser mechanism, and the laser fret slot sensor.\n                    It is all controlled by a single Arduino Mega, which monitors the various sensors and controls the stepper motors and pneumatics. To press\n                    the frets, the robot performs the following steps:\n                    <ol>\n                        <li>Measure the slot location by sliding the fret board in front of the laser</li>\n                        <li>Move the fret board to align the slot with the glue arm</li>\n                        <li>Swing the glue arm towards the fret board</li>\n                        <li>When the glue arm reaches the start of the fret board, activate the pneumatic valve to dispense glue</li>\n                        <li>When the glue arm reaches the end of the fret board, deactivate the glue valve</li>\n                        <li>Move the fret board so that the glue arm aligns with the next slot</li>\n                        <li>Repeat the glue process, reversing the motion of the glue arm, towards its original position</li>\n                        <li>Move the fret board so that the slot aligns with the press mechanism</li>\n                        <li>Swing the press mechanism over top of the fret board</li>\n                        <li>Activate the pneumatic dropping the press mechanism and fret wire into the slot</li>\n                        <li>Retract the press mechanism (this unspools fret wire for the next slot)</li>\n                        <li>Activate the pneumatics to close the snippers, and cut the fret wire</li>\n                        <li>Deactivate the pneumatics to open the snippers</li>\n                        <li>Repeat the above steps for the rest of the frets on the fret board</li>\n                    </ol>\n                </p>\n                <h3>Software</h3>\n                <p>\n                    To control the robot, I developed a C++ driver program, and a number of support modules. For development and debugging, the code makes\n                    extensive use of the Arduino&apos;s serial communication capabilities&mdash;keywords with optional parameters can be sent to the robot to\n                    instruct it to perform any of its possible operations (e.g. jog the fret board platform to a certain location, activate a specific pneumatic\n                    valve, measure the laser intensity, etc.). For normal operations, I wrote modules to provide convenient interfaces for each component of the\n                    robot, including low level components like stepper motors, limit switches, pneumatics, and also higher level components, like the glue arm,\n                    or presser subassemblies. To start the fret press sequence, an operator simply loads a fret board onto the robot, and then presses the two\n                    start buttons, kicking off a software sequence that runs each of the steps listed above for pressing frets.\n                </p>\n                <h3>Laser Fret Detector</h3>\n                <p>\n                    In addition to software work, I also helped develop solutions for several mechanical and electrical issues facing the project. In\n                    particular, I developed the laser system for accurately measuring the precise location of each fret on the fret board. The robot uses the\n                    fret locations to know where to move the fret board so that it exactly lines up with the glue arm, as well as the press mechanism. The\n                    detector works by shining a laser across the path of the fret board. As the board passes in front of the laser, it occludes the beam from\n                    the detector. When a slot passes in front of the beam, some of the laser light is allowed through, which is picked up by a photodiode on the\n                    other side of the machine. In software, the peaks in brightness are then correlated with the step count from the stepper motor, indicating\n                    precisely where each fret is relative to the robot.\n                </p>\n                <h3>Videos</h3>\n                <Grid columns={3}>\n                    <Grid.Column>\n                        <Grid.Row>\n                            <img src={laser} style={{ width: '100%' }} />\n                            <p>Laser fret slot detection system</p>\n                        </Grid.Row>\n                    </Grid.Column>\n                    <Grid.Column>\n                        <Grid.Row>\n                            <img src={glue} style={{ width: '100%' }} />\n                            <p>Glue dispensing mechanism</p>\n                        </Grid.Row>\n                    </Grid.Column>\n\n                    <Grid.Column>\n                        <Grid.Row>\n                            <img src={press} style={{ width: '100%' }} />\n                            <p>Fret press mechanism</p>\n                        </Grid.Row>\n                    </Grid.Column>\n                </Grid>\n                <br />\n                <YouTube videoId=\"1CZEYDhc4wY\" opts={{ width: '100%' }} />\n                <h3>Links</h3>\n                <List>\n                    <List.Item>\n                        <span>\n                            <Icon name=\"github\" size=\"big\" />\n                            <ExternalLink href=\"https://github.com/david-andrew/PRS_robot\">Github Repo</ExternalLink>\n                        </span>\n                    </List.Item>\n                </List>\n            </PageContainer>\n        </>\n    )\n}\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/rebel_crash.0aeea484.jpg\";","import React from 'react'\nimport { PageContainer, PageHeading, Collage } from '../../Components'\nimport { ExternalLink, getImageSources } from '../../utilities'\nimport { List, Icon } from 'semantic-ui-react'\nimport YouTube from 'react-youtube'\nimport rebel_crash from '../../images/astrojays/rebel_crash.jpg'\n\nexport const AstroJays = (): JSX.Element => {\n    const rebel1_imageSrcs = getImageSources(require.context('../../images/astrojays/rebel_level_1'))\n    const rebel2_imageSrcs = getImageSources(require.context('../../images/astrojays/rebel_level_2'))\n    const sac_imageSrcs = getImageSources(require.context('../../images/astrojays/sac'))\n\n    return (\n        <>\n            <PageContainer>\n                <PageHeading />\n                <p>\n                    During my senior year of college, I helped a friend found the JHU Rocketry Club, now known as the{' '}\n                    <ExternalLink href=\"https://www.facebook.com/HopkinsRocketry/\">AstroJays</ExternalLink>. The goal of the club was to allow students to\n                    participate in High Power Rocket (HPR) activities, i.e. launching rockets for fun, or in collaboration with other research efforts on\n                    campus.\n                </p>\n                <h3>HPR Certification Levels</h3>\n                <p>\n                    Early on in the club, members were provided kits for level 1 class rockets, so that they could start working their certification levels. To\n                    give a brief overview, hobby rockets with motors ranging from class H to class O are regulated, and require levels of certification to\n                    legally operate. Class partitions per motor size are as follows:\n                    <ul>\n                        <li>Level 1: Class H - I</li>\n                        <li>Level 2: Class J - L</li>\n                        <li>Level 3: Class M - O</li>\n                    </ul>\n                    Anything beyond class O is no longer considered hobby level, and requires specific approval from various regulatory bodies like the FAA. To\n                    earn a level certification, an individual must demonstrate a working rocket with that level of motor (known as a certification flight).\n                    Certification flights are the only time when someone with a lower level certification may use a higher class level of motor. Ultimately the\n                    goal was for the club to design and build a custom level 3 rocket for the Spaceport America Cup, but that meant that someone in the club\n                    needed to be at least level 2 certified, in order to handle the level 3 motor.\n                </p>\n                <h3>Rebel Scum</h3>\n                <p>\n                    For my certification attempts, I started with the{' '}\n                    <ExternalLink href=\"https://www.apogeerockets.com/Rocket_Kits/Skill_Level_3_Kits/Hi-Tech\">High-Tech</ExternalLink> rocket kit sold at Apogee\n                    Rockets. The level 1 certification simply required me to build the kit, and successfully launch and recover the rocket via the normal\n                    parachute system. My certification flight went perfectly, and I recovered my rocket completely intact.\n                </p>\n                <Collage imageSrcs={rebel1_imageSrcs} rowHeight=\"350px\" />\n                <p>\n                    Following my level 1 certification, I began to retrofit my rocket for a level 2 certification flight. The requirements for a level 2 flight\n                    include using a motor from the J-L range, as well as demonstrating an electronic avionics system&mdash;because level 2 rockets fly so much\n                    higher, they require a drogue parachute to deploy at apogee, and then rely on an electronics system to deploy the main chute closer to the\n                    ground. You also have to pass a written test, in addition to the flight, in order to complete the level 2 certification process.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    To upgrade my rocket, performed the following modifications:\n                    <ul>\n                        <li>replaced engine mount with custom structure designed for a larger class J motor</li>\n                        <li>added an arduino based avionics system for detecting altitude and activating the main chute</li>\n                        <li>replaced the old fins with twice as many to ensure stability</li>\n                        <li>added a new coat of paint and decals</li>\n                    </ul>\n                    The it was with the addition of the Star Wars decals that the rocket earned the name Rebel Scum.\n                </p>\n                <Collage imageSrcs={rebel2_imageSrcs} rowSizes={[2, 2, 2]} rowHeight=\"500px\" />\n                <YouTube videoId=\"teXu-0AXwcE\" opts={{ width: '100%' }} />\n                <br />\n                <p>Unfortunately the rocket did not separate at apogee, causing it to ballistically arc downward and crash into the ground.</p>\n                <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>\n                    <img src={rebel_crash} style={{ width: '100%' }} />\n                </div>\n                <br />\n                <p>\n                    Upon inspecting the wreckage, I did note that the parachute mechanism had activated, so it likely would have been a successful flight had\n                    separation occurred.

At a high level, the system performs sensor fusion between the wheel odometry and a GPS sensor to provide an\n                    accurate estimate of RoboJay&apos;s position and orientation on the map. The existing RoboJay body included high accuracy rotary encoders\n                    attached to each wheel, which made them ideal for tracking fine scale motion not easily detectable by a GPS. I hooked the rotary encoders up\n                    to a new BeagleBone Blue microcontroller, which served as the main sensor and control interface for the robot. The BeagleBone communicates\n                    with a laptop that consumes the sensor data, runs the sensor fusion algorithm, and generates high level commands for the robot to follow\n                    based on its location (the GPS is hooked directly to the computer since it requires specific computer drivers to run).\n                </p>\n                <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>\n                    <img src={block_diagram_inverted} style={{ width: '75%' }} />\n                </div>\n                <br />\n                <p>\n                    With this system, I was able to successfully demonstrate RoboJay localizing its position around campus, and commanding navigation towards\n                    preplanned waypoint sequences.

My team of three developed\n                    a biometric access and security system for our sponsor, the JHU WSE machine shop.\n                </p>\n                <h3>Background</h3>\n                <p>\n                    The Whiting School provides a student machine shop with various machines, such as lathes, mills, wire EDM, etc. for use by various labs and\n                    departments around campus. Students with proper safety training, and access to a valid budget may use the machine shop for school and\n                    research projects. It goes without saying that a machine shop is quite a dangerous facility, especially for people who lack proper training\n                    for each piece of equipment. Historically the WSE machine shop operated on the honor system&mdash;students would participate in a short\n                    training course for each piece of equipment, and then after each use of a machine, fill out a form indicating which machine, how long, and\n                    which budget to charge. The system was frequently abused, with both untrained students operating machines, in addition to individuals\n                    &apos;forgetting&apos; to charge their machine time. So in order to mitigate these issued, the machine shop tasked my team to devise an\n                    interlock system for controlling access to machines, and automatically billing usage.\n                </p>\n                <YouTube videoId=\"rs2gCPOII2A\" opts={{ width: '100%' }} />\n                <h3>Solution Overview</h3>\n                <p>\n                    My team&apos;s solutions seeks to solve the following problem: Ensure that people operating machines in the machine shop have the proper\n                    training, and ensure that all machine usage is properly billed. To solve this, we developed a software controlled interlock system that uses\n                    fingerprint biometrics to track who is using what machines.\n                </p>\n                <img src={architecture} style={{ width: '100%' }} />\n                <p>\n                    To use a machine, a user must verify their identity by scanning their fingerprint. The system then checks a database to ensure the user\n                    possesses the proper training for the machine they are accessing. If the user is trained, they then can select one of their valid budgets to\n                    bill. Once these steps are complete, the system then unlocks the machine by activating a power relay which connects the machine to main\n                    power. The user then uses the machine, and when they are finished, the system locks the machine and logs the amount of time to bill the user\n                    for.\n                </p>\n                <h3>Why Fingerprints</h3>\n                <p>\n                    For this specific problem, there are several compounding factors that led us to choose fingerprint biometrics for user verification. In\n                    general, when trying to verify an individual&apos;s identity, typically there are three types of credentials you can use:\n                    <ol>\n                        <li>Something only you &quot;know&quot;, e.g. a password, answer to a security question, etc.</li>\n                        <li>Something only you &quot;have&quot;, e.g. a physical key, a cell phone, an ID card, etc.</li>\n                        <li>Something only you &quot;are&quot;, i.e. unique biometric signatures such as a fingerprint, face scan, handwriting, dna, etc.</li>\n                    </ol>\n                    For many systems, the first two are often adequate to confidently verify user identity. For example, to log into a bank account with\n                    2-factor authentication (2FA), a user will enter their password, which only they know, and then enter a code generated on their phone which\n                    verifies that they have a unique object, i.e. their phone. When presented with these secure identifiers, the bank can be sure of the\n                    user&apos;s identity, and unlock their account.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    For our system however, the first two forms of identification are not adequate, because our users are prone to behave in an adversarial way\n                    towards our system. For a bank password/2FA code, both the bank and the user want to ensure that it is only the user that has access to the\n                    bank account&mdash;i.e. users don&apos;t want their password to be stolen. In the machine shop though, a common situation is one where a\n                    campus club or design team (e.g. Baja SAE, Rocketry, JHU ASME, etc.) might compel members to perform a task on a machine they are not\n                    trained, due to time crunch. In this situation, trained members who possess any hypothetical credentials would be incentivised to give them\n                    away to the untrained members. Historically, keycard access was required to enter the machine shop, and trained club members would\n                    frequently give their access card to untrained members, so that a task could be completed more quickly.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    To solve this issue of potentially adversarial users, we chose to authenticate via biometrics, which are not easily transferable to other\n                    individuals&mdash;an individual cannot easily &quot;give&quot; someone else their fingerprint, facial features, their iris pattern, etc.,\n                    which makes them quite an attractive option to ensure that the user is always who they say they are. An added benefit for the user is that\n                    biometrics are seamless&mdash;no passwords to remember, and no special ID cards to bring everywhere.\n                </p>\n                <h3>Gatekeeper UI</h3>\n                <p>\n                    In order to make the system as seamless as possible, I developed a custom touch screen user interface. The UI was written in Qt, and runs on\n                    a so-called Gatekeeper&mdash;A Raspberry Pi connected to the interlock mechanism that controls the whole system. The Gatekeeper UI allows a\n                    user to select a budget to bill machine usage, as well as providing useful feedback and messages during the session.\n                </p>\n                <Collage imageSrcs={gatekeeper_imageSrcs} rowSizes={[3, 3]} />\n                <h3>Kiosk UI</h3>\n                <p>\n                    Additionally I developed a companion UI to run the kiosk system, used to register new users into the system. The kiosk provides also\n                    provides many administrative functions for the system, such as adding and modifying budgets, machines, and users in the system.\n                </p>\n                <Collage imageSrcs={kiosk_imageSrcs} rowSizes={[4]} />\n                <h3>Back End</h3>\n                <p>\n                    In addition to the user facing UI and Gatekeeper, I supported the development of several back end components of the system. When a user\n                    scans their finger at a gatekeeper, the gatekeeper connects over a network to a server which provides records of which fingerprints match to\n                    which users, as well as budgets, machine authorization, etc. possessed by the user. The back end is written in python, and is split into two\n                    parts: a host running on a university maintained server, and a client running on each gatekeeper and kiosk connected to the system. The host\n                    serves a SQLite database, in addition to performing several bookkeeping tasks such as emailing admins a monthly billing report, recording\n                    incidents (e.g. failed login attempts), and emailing admins a new system override code at the start of each week. The client manages all\n                    non-UI related tasks, mainly managing the fingerprint matching process, and controlling all connected peripherals, like the interlock relay,\n                    and machine usage monitoring sensors.\n                </p>\n                <h3>Pictures</h3>\n                <Collage imageSrcs={promo_imageSrcs} />\n                <p>Shots of one of several Gatekeepers installed in the machine shop, as well as the kiosk system.</p>\n                <h3>Live Demo</h3>\n                <YouTube videoId=\"iTQsDDEW6qs\" opts={{ width: '100%' }} />\n                <p>\n                    User logging in and unlocking a machine.
